Moving from car to sidewalk? Simply lift the carrier off the base, release the wheels and you’re rolling in no time. From backseat to street in a heartbeat! Maneuvering stairs? Retract the wheels, carry up/down steps, pop the wheels back down and stroll on. No struggling with multiple pieces of gear. No disturbing your little one. This car seat stroller combo makes every trip easier. While researching the best car seats for your little one, consider this: DualRide’s anti-rebound base absorbs and dissipates crash forces to provide additional stability and give you peace of mind, so you can make the Shyft with confidence.

With SensorSafe™ to connect you to your little one from the backseat, the DualRide is the savvy choice when it comes to child car seat safety. In car seat mode, DualRide’s integrated SensorSafe technology alerts you in real-time to 4 potentially unsafe conditions from your child’s car seat via Bluetooth: unexpected chest clip unbuckling, temperature too hot or too cold in the car, child unattended in the car, and child seated too long.

At IIT, while studying a Bauhaus design curriculum devised by Mies van der Rohe, Abloh began to craft the principles of his broader art practice. The Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago presented a major traveling survey of Abloh’s work in summer 2019—one of the highest attended exhibitions in the museum’s history. Abloh was the Chief Creative Director and founder of Off-White and from 2018 to 2021 Men’s Artistic Director at Louis Vuitton, amongst other endeavors.\nThe Sneaker as (Hyper)Object\nIn 2016, sportswear manufacturer Nike and fashion designer Virgil Abloh joined forces to create a sneaker collection celebrating 10 of the Oregon-based company’s most iconic shoes. With their project The Ten—which reimagines icons like Air Jordan 1, Air Max 90, Air Force 1, and Air Presto, among others—they reinvigorated sneaker culture.\nVirgil Abloh’s new designs offer deep insights into engineering ingenuity and burst with cultural cachet. Drawing on the genius of the original shoe using lettering, ironic labels, collage, and sculpting techniques, Abloh plays with language and sculptural elements to construct new meaning. Inspired by the wit of Dadaism, architectural theory, and avant-garde happenings, he analyzes what makes each shoe iconic and deconstructs it into an artistic assemblage, making each shoe into a piece of industrial design, a readymade sculpture, and a wearable all at once.\nCopyright: Virgil Abloh/Nike\nIcons traces Abloh’s investigative, creative process through documentation of the prototypes, original text messages from Abloh to Nike designers, and treasures from the Nike archives.\nCopyright: Virgil Abloh/Nike\nWe find Swooshes sliced away from Air Jordans and reapplied with tape or thread, Abloh’s typical text fragments in quotation marks on Air Force 1, and All Stars cut into pieces.\nCopyright: Virgil Abloh/Nike\nWe take a look behind the scenes and witness Abloh’s DIY approach, which gives each model in the collection its own unique touch.\nThe book documents Abloh’s cooperative way of working and reaffirms the power of print. For its design Nike and Abloh partnered with the acclaimed London-based design studio Zak Group. Together they conceived a two-part compendium, equal parts catalog and conceptual toolbox. The first part of the book presents a visual culture of sneakers while a lexicon in the second part defines the key people, places, objects, ideas, materials, and scenes from which the project grew. Texts by Nike’s Nicholas Schonberger, writer Troy Patterson, curator and historian Glenn Adamson, and Virgil Abloh himself frame the collaborative work within fashion and design history. A foreword by Hiroshi Fujiwara places the project within the historical continuum of Nike collaborators.\"\nList Price: $80.0\n\nShopping List\ncodename: books_8\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $64.0\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Designed specifically for intensive workloads, high-quality creative content, and gaming, the P5 Plus with heatsink is ideal for use with PlayStation 5, supports Microsoft DirectStorage, and is also backward compatible with most Gen3 systems for ultimate flexibility. Engineered by Micron with Gen4 NVMe technology, the Crucial P5 Plus includes advanced features like full hardware-based encryption, dynamic write acceleration, and adaptive thermal protection to keep your data safe while enhancing system reliability. * Typical I/O performance numbers as measured using CrystalDiskMark with a queue depth of 128 and write cache enabled. Fresh out-of-box (FOB) state is assumed. For performance measurement purposes, the SSD may be restored to FOB state using the secure erase command. System variations will affect measured results. When installed in a Gen3 system, typical read/write speeds are 3,300/2,700MB/s. ** Some of the storage capacity is used for formatting and other purposes and is not available for data storage. 1GB equals 1 billion bytes. Not all capacities available at initial launch. *** Compared to Gen4 SSD performance without DirectStorage, based on internal test results with supported GPU that uses GPU decompression. **** Mean time to failure (MTTF) can be predicted based on component reliability data using the methods referenced in the Telcordia SR-332 reliability prediction procedures for electronic equipment and is validated in Reliability Demonstration Test (RDT). ***** Warranty valid for five years from the original date of purchase or before writing the maximum total bytes written (TBW) as published in the product datasheet and as measured in the product’s SMART data, whichever comes first. ****** See https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/ for specs and installation instructions. ******* Calculated by comparing P5 Plus’s sequential reads of 6600MB/s to the previous generation’s (P5) speed of 3400MB/s, or to the SATA’s (BX500) speed of 540MB/s.

The low-distortion, custom-built driver delivers crisp, clear high notes and deep, rich bass in stunning definition. So every sound is more vivid than ever..Note : If the size of the earbud tips does not match the size of your ear canals or the headset is not worn properly in your ears, you may not obtain the correct sound qualities or call performance. Change the earbud tips to ones that fit more snugly in your ear\nNEXT-LEVEL ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLATION – Up to 2x more Active Noise Cancellation than the previous AirPods Pro for dramatically less noise on your commute, or when you want to focus. Adaptive Transparency lets you comfortably hear the world around you, adjusting for intense noise—like sirens or construction—in real time.\nCUSTOMIZABLE FIT – Now with four pairs of silicone tips (XS, S, M, L) to fit a wider range of ears and provide all-day comfort. The tips create an acoustic seal to help keep out noise and secure AirPods Pro in place.\nSOUND ALL AROUND – Personalized Spatial Audio surrounds you in sound tuned just for you. It works with dynamic head tracking to immerse you deeper in music and movies.\nHIGHER LEVEL OF CONTROL – Now you can swipe the stem to adjust volume. Press it to play and pause music or to answer and end a call, or hold it to switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Adaptive Transparency.\nA LEAP IN BATTERY LIFE – Up to 6 hours of listening time with Active Noise Cancellation enabled — 33% more than AirPods Pro (1st generation). With the charging case, you can get 30 hours of total listening time with Active Noise Cancellation enabled — 6 hours longer than AirPods Pro (1st generation).\nA MORE CAPABLE CASE – Keep track of AirPods Pro with Precision Finding and a built-in speaker. A lanyard loop keeps your AirPods Pro close. Charge with an Apple Watch or MagSafe charger, or use the Lightning connector or a Qi-certified charger.\nMAGICAL EXPERIENCE – Quick access to Siri by saying “Hey Siri”.

For those searching for telescopes for astronomy beginners that are infused with the latest computer technology, Celestron’s NexStar 8SE Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescope fits the bill perfectly. The NexStar 8SE Computerized Telescope features Celestron’s iconic “orange tube” design and updated technology with the latest features for amazing stargazing for beginners and experienced observers. Celestron’s signature telescope combines advanced features and excellent optics in one easy-to-use system, the NexStar 8SE. It’s the perfect choice for your first serious telescope, offering striking views at an economical price.\n\nThe eight-inch primary mirror in this computerized telescope packs enough light-gathering ability to observe the best that our Solar System has to offer, from Saturn’s rings to the cloud bands on Jupiter and geographic features on the surface of the Moon. When it comes to deep sky objects, take your 8SE to a dark-sky site and you’ll see hundreds of pinpoint stars in the Hercules Globular Cluster, the spiral arms of the Whirlpool Galaxy, and more. Featuring a database of more than 40,000 celestial objects, the 8SE’s GoTo mount automatically locates and tracks objects for you. You can also take a Sky Tour and let your telescope show you the best objects currently visible. The single fork arm design and sturdy steel tripod all assemble and break down from separate components for easy transportation. SkyAlign technology gets your telescope aligned and ready to observe in minutes. Even if you’re unfamiliar with the night sky, you can easily align your telescope on any 3 bright objects.\n\nThe NexStar 8SE is a telescope that will grow with you as you advance in the hobby of astronomy. It’s compatible with all the high-tech accessories advanced users love. Provide GPS coordinates to your telescope with SkySync, or add automatic alignment functionality with StarSense AutoAlign.\n\nBuy with confidence from the world’s #1 telescope brand, based in California since 1960. You’ll also receive a two-year warranty and unlimited access to technical support from our team of US-based experts.\nAmazon.com\nAmazon.com Review Celestron's Nexstar 8 SE telescope combines excellent optics and computerized \"GoTo\" tracking in a package that's light, portable and affordable. The legendary performance of Celestron's orange tube C8 telescope has been updated with high performance Starbright XLT coatings, and the single arm Nexstar mount now includes Celestron's easy to use \"SkyAlign\" technology.\nThe Nexstar 8 SE upholds Celestron's reputation for quality optics. When I use an 11mm Plossl eyepiece (almost 200x magnification) for example, I can easily see the Cassini Division in Saturn's rings. When I look at Jupiter, the pale orange color of Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot is visible, and I've even been able to identify the polar caps and spot dust storms on the planet Mars. A 20mm Plossl eyepiece (about 100x magnification) is a good choice for viewing galaxies and star clusters. When I look at globular cluster M13 in the constellation Hercules the high contrast XLT optics show me a glowing snowflake made of hundreds of tiny pin-point stars! And a low power 32mm Plossl eyepiece is a good choice for views of larger deep space highlights like the Andromeda Galaxy and the Orion Nebula.\nCelestron's patented \"SkyAlign\" system makes the Nexstar 8 SE very easy to use. I just pick the nearest town from the built-in list, enter the date and time, and point the telescope at three bright stars. I don't need a star chart because \"SkyAlign\" identifies the stars for me. When I just want a quick look at the moon or a planet, I like to use the \"Solar System Align\" option. After entering the date and time, I just point the telescope at the moon and press the \"Align\" key. That's all it takes, the computer takes over and the telescope begins tracking quietly and accurately. At star parties I often have my Nexstar up and running while older computerized telescopes are still waiting for their alignment stars to appear in the twilight.\nThe Nexstar 8 SE comes with a simple red-dot finder scope and a basic 25mm eyepiece. You'll want to add a few good eyepieces to take full advantage of the Nexstar 8 SE's excellent optics. At the very least get Celestron's bargain priced Accessory Kit which includes high and low power plossl eyepieces, or treat yourself to some top rated Tele Vue eyepieces. At twenty-four pounds total weight, the Nexstar 8 SE is unusually light and portable for an eight-inch telescope. The drawback of course is that some people will find it too light. Like other Schmidt Cassegrain (SCT) telescopes there are plenty of optional accessories to upgrade this telescope with, such as heavy duty tripods and an optical finder scope. If you want to try astro-photography, however, check out Celestron's CPC 800 Telescope which features a heavy duty mount and tripod and an 8x50 optical finder scope right out of the box. --Jeff Phillips\nPros:\nExcellent optics\nEasy computerized GoTo tracking\nLight, portable and affordable\nCons:\nPlastic accessories\nShort battery life\nToo light for astro-photography\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\"\nList Price: $1599.0\n\nShopping List\ncodename: electronics_227\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $1279.2\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

This majestic Downswept Douglas Fir tree is 7.5 feet tall and 59 inches in diameter at the bottom, giving the tree a wide profile. Friends and family alike will marvel at how the tree closely mimics those outside. Molded from real tree branches for an authentic living tree appearance, this tree features our trademarked ‘Feel Real’ technology. Hundreds of crush-resistant polyethylene tips form full bodied branches, creating a tree with remarkable realism. The tree is designed with a hinged branch system that allows the branches to swing down for a quick and simple set-up and fold back in for easy storage. Set aside 45-60 minutes after assembly to properly shape the tree by peeling back the branches and pulling the tips apart to give the branches a more full-bodied look. Once the tree is fluffed to your liking, weave your desired lights through the branches starting from the top and moving down towards the bottom. Before dressing the tree in twinkling lights and glistening ornaments, consider placing it in a living room or dining area where it can be viewed from multiple angles and does not block any entryways. Constructed with sturdy, high quality materials and hypo-allergenic, fire-resistant needles, this tree is built to bring holiday cheer for years to come.

                "content": "Inventory List:\nProduct1\nCodename: movies-tv_16\nTitle: \"Shaw Brothers Classics: Volume One [Blu-ray]\"\nDescription: \"This spectacular box set comprises 11 classic martial arts films from the famous Shaw Brothers' library, featuring some of their greatest stars—Jimmy Wang Yu (One-Armed Swordsman), Cheng Pei-pei (Come Drink with Me), Lo Lieh (King Boxer), Ku Feng (The Five Venoms), and David Chiang (The Boxer From Shantung). Many of these films are debuting for the first time on Blu-ray. Get ready for some exciting thrills and chills as heroes meet villains in a duel to the death! The Assassin In the same year that director/writer Chang Cheh and star Jimmy Wang Yu revolutionized Hong Kong kung fu cinema with One-Armed Swordsman, they also collaborated on this epic of the Six Kingdoms era. Here, Yu is a two-armed swordsman who is also a Wei Empire patriot. Inside the Han Empire, Han Kuei, who comes from the royal family, assumes full power and wants to eliminate loyal officer Yen Sui. Later, our main character is betrayed by a jealous rival and becomes a village butcher. But when he meets Yen Sui, he is sent back on the road of vengeance. Chiao Chiao, the lovely and talented costar of One-Armed Swordsman, here plays Hsia, the love of the hero's life and the strong woman who survives to protect their child. The Thundering Sword Superstar swordswoman Cheng Pei-pei, (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), stars as the daughter of the Poison Master in a Romeo and Juliet-style martial arts adventure concerning a search for the magical \"Heaven and Earth\" weapon in The Thundering Sword. The Golden Swallow The indomitable martial arts team of director Chang Cheh and stunt choreographer Liu Chia-liang continues the compelling saga of The Golden Swallow from King Hu's Come Drink with Me in this sequel of heartbreaking romance, intrigue and stunning action. The Jade Raksha Thanks in great part to Cheng Pei-pei, women in martial arts movies played a more central role in the plots and the swordswomen of the genre became some of the most charismatic figures in Hong Kong cinema. In The Jade Raksha, Cheng Pei-pei becomes a human combine harvester as she hacks and whacks a path through life, avenging the death of her family under the moniker \"The Jade Raksha.\" The Bells of Death The Bells of Death is a whirlwind story about a man embarking on a life-long journey to master the sword, then find and eliminate the three men who killed his family and abducted his sister. The Sword of Swords Jimmy Wang Yu had just exploded into superstardom as One-Armed Swordsman when he teamed with respected writer/director Cheng Kang for this tale of master martial artists vying for the title blad—a \"weapon of exceptional brilliance.\" And with legendary martial arts choreographers Lau Kar-leung and Tang Chia directing the action, the result is a superb, flat-out adventure of intrigue, deception, and an abduction, delivering one battle after another until it culminates in an amazing all-out slaughter. Killer Dart Rampaging bandits are pillaging peaceful Chinese villages until the grieving dart master Liu Wen Lung sets out with his student, son, and servant to avenge his murdered wife and set things right. Renowned director Ho Meng-Hua—soon to be internationally famous for The Flying Guillotine—masterfully balances action with intrigue and romance, as the path of righteousness is littered with lies…and corpses. The Invincible Fist The Invincible Fist is one of the few films where the godfather of the kung fu film Chang Cheh headlined Lo Lieh as the leading hero three years before Lo would become the Shaw Brothers' first international star in King Boxer (aka Five Fingers of Death). Here he plays a dedicated chief constable for Tsang Chou village who falls in love with the blind daughter of a bandit who is wreaking havoc. Joining him in all the action and emotion are award-winning actor Ku Feng and future superstar David Chiang. Dragon Swamp Cheng Pei-pei, the screen's greatest swordswoman, teams with Lo Lieh for this amazing, fast-paced adventure of the \"Martial Arts World\"—where everyone is killing to gain the famous \"Jade Dragon Sword.\" Fascinating characters, like the Roaming Knight and the Master of Dragon Swamp, clash in this family feud, which takes place over twenty years. In addition to the spectacular fights, this special production holds an emotional wallop for the finale. The Flying Dagger Godfather of the kung fu film, director Chang Cheh is famous for introducing the revolutionary concept of \"yanggang\" (macho) martial arts movies. Until then, female stars (often in male swordsman roles) ruled the screens. This collaboration between him and swordswoman supreme Cheng Pei-pei is exceptional indeed. Cheng could hold her own with any man, freeing Chang to create the best of all possible martial arts worlds. The Golden Sword Lo Wei remains internationally famous for directing Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan's first major movies. Cheng Pei-pei is now internationally famous for her superlative villainous role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But both were superstars in Hong Kong for decades prior, so any teaming of the superlative \"swordswoman supreme\" and the vaunted director/writer/actor is cause for celebration. Kao Yuen joins them as a noble swordsman, and award-winning actor Ku Feng stars as the Frontier Terror in the evocative and effective \"Martial Arts World\" adventure.\n\nBonus Content:\nDisc 1 - The Assassin (1967):\nAudio Commentary by David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 2 - The Thundering Sword:\nFrom a Western Perspective: An Interview About the Transnational Appeal of The Shaw Brothers with Academic Leon Hunt, Author of \"Kung Fu Cult Masters: From Bruce Lee To Crouching Tiger\"\nInterview with Author and Critic Kim Newman About The Western \"Breakthrough\" Films of Sir Run Run Shaw, Which Took the Producer From East To West\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 3 - The Golden Swallow:\nAudio Commentary by Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nInterview with Actress Cheng Pei-Pei by Frédéric Ambroisine\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 4 - The Jade Raksha:\nSlicing at the Stars: An Interview with Critic and Hong Kong Film Expert Tony Rayns, About The Emergence, Key Players, and Success of The Shaw Brothers Wuxia Film\nA Very Vocal Violence: Hong Kong Based Dubber Peter Boczar Reflects on His Time Behind the Microphone for a Number Of Martial Arts Masterpieces.\nDisc 5 - The Bells of Death:\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 6 - The Sword of Swords:\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 7 - Killer Darts:\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, veteran Hong Kong film critic at easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 8 - The Invincible Fist:\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, veteran Hong Kong film critic at easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 9 - Dragon Swamp:\nAudio Commentary with Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 10 - The Flying Dagger:\nAudio Commentary with Frank Djeng of the New York Asian Film Festival\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 11 - The Golden Sword:\nAudio Commentary with Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nCelestial Trailer\n]]>\"\nList Price: $169.98\n\nShopping List\ncodename: movies-tv_16\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $135.984\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

                "content": "Inventory List:\nProduct1\nCodename: movies-tv_18\nTitle: \"Shaw Brothers Classics: Volume Two [Blu-ray]\"\nDescription: \"This spectacular box set comprises 12 classic martial arts films from the famous Shaw Brothers' library, featuring some of their greatest stars—Cheng Pei-pei (Come Drink with Me), Lo Lieh (King Boxer), Sammo Hung (Wheels on Meals), Ti Lung (A Better Tomorrow), and David Chiang (The Boxer from Shantung). Many of these films are debuting for the first time on Blu-ray. Get ready for some exciting thrills and chills as heroes meet villains in a duel to the death! Lady of Steel: Cheng Pei-pei was Hong Kong's first and most celebrated queen of kung fu because her performances set all the standards for future female martial arts stars like Michelle Yeoh. Lady Of Steel is a high-plains-drifter adventure where Cheng Pei-pei plays a swordswoman on a mission: to find the bandits that killed her parents and save the country from foreign invaders. Brothers Five: Years before he was to become famous for directing Bruce Lee in Fist of Fury and Jackie Chan in New Fist of Fury, Lo Wei teamed with superstar swordswoman Cheng Pei-pei (Come Drink with Me) for this action thriller of brotherly love…and death. She stars as Yen Lai, the one woman who can reunite the Kao brothers to rid the Teng Lung Manor of killers—as well as take revenge for their father's murder. The Crimson Charm: Huang Feng both writes and directs this \"Martial Arts World\" thriller of a noble swordsman and a one-armed swordswoman up against the vicious Crimson Charm gang of thieves and cutthroats. The lovely and lethal Ivy Ling Po teams with the amazing Chang I for a classic tale of good versus evil in which the best man—and one-armed woman—wins. The Shadow Whip: This top-ten box office hit reunites the star duo from Come Drink with Me in another classic action adventure. Cheng Pei-pei (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) radiates her trademark charm while wielding the deadly title weapon, which is implicated in multiple murders and a major heist. Whether single-handedly fighting sixteen bandits or avenging her father's brutal death, she demonstrates why she was Hong Kong's number one swordswoman—and no slouch with the whip either! The Delightful Forest Co-directed by Chang Cheh and Pao Hsueh-li, and written by Ni Kuang, Chang Cheh and Chin Shu-Mei, The Delightful Forest revolves around the legendary hero Wu Sung (Ti Lung), who was sent to the prison in the Meng province after murdering his sister-in-law and a local ruffian. There he was acquainted with the prison officer \"Golden Eye\" Shih En (Tien Ching), who saved Wu from the baton punishment required for new prisoners. Wu found out that Shih's restaurant, \"Delightful Forest,\" was taken by the local thug \"Door God\" Chiang Chung (Chu Mu). The Devil's Mirror: This is Sun Chung's very first film for the Shaw Brothers, making it especially interesting and important. He hit the ground running with this action-filled tale of a \"Devil Girl\" who is setting one clan against another to get her hands on two amazing mirrors with supernatural powers. Only a noble swordsman (played by Lau Dan) and beautiful swordswoman (played by The Thundering Sword star Shu Pei-pei) can stop her. Man of Iron: Chen Kuan-tai exuded incredible power on screen, which his directors used to great advantage in this fight-filled follow-up to the smash hit The Boxer from Shantung. The only thing Chou Lien Huan does wrong is win some money gambling with a Shanghai gang leader's playboy son…but that's enough for the father and child to want obsessive revenge. It all culminates in an incredible climatic fight, choreographed by the legendary Lau Kar-leung and Chan Chuen, co-star of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury. The Water Margin: The Chang Cheh-directed The Water Margin is the martial arts epic of epics…of epics. Based on the true legend of how 108 rebel heroes living in the mountains were able to repeatedly defeat invading Sung armies, the film starred just about anyone who was a name at Shaw Brothers at the time, like David Chiang, Chen Kuan-tai and Ti Lung. The primitive battles ultimately end in sharp, visually effective images of death and defeat. This is a must-see for any movie fan. The Bride from Hell: Never marry a possessed woman…especially one possessed by the spirit of a girl murdered by the uncle of the groom! That is the moral of this fascinating production, released a full two years before the international success of The Exorcist. Justice must be done and an exorcism, Hong Kong-style, must be performed before anyone can rest in peace. Talented Margaret Hsing Hui makes a fetching spirit in this mystery thriller that also incorporates a laugh or two amidst the chills. Heroes Two: Of the dozens of great martial arts movies made by this prolific and respected director, this tale of legendary Shaolin avengers Fang Shih-yu and Hung Hsi-kuan is often considered one of his best. His collaboration with equally renowned kung fu choreographer Lar Kar-leung was apparent in all the performances, but especially with that of charismatic, capable, then 19-year-old Alexander Fu Sheng. This powerful production is a true landmark in kung fu film history. The Flying Guillotine: Director Ho Meng-hua attained cult status among Western kung fu film fans with The Flying Guillotine. One of the Shaw Brothers' biggest martial arts stars, Chen Kuan-tai, plays the leader of a group of killers, commissioned by the Ching Emperor to use a deadly, beheading weapon to assassinate dissidents. Although based on a true story, the film's weapon was a complete fabrication because in real life, no one ever survived to tell what the actual weapon really looked like.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [Super Deluxe 4 CD/DVD/Blu-ray] by The Beatles\"\nDescription: \"Includes a 28-page booklet with rare photos, notes on the recording sessions and lyrics. The Beatles: George Harrison (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, sitar, tamboura, harmonica, tambourine, comb & paper); John Lennon (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, piano, Hammond organ, maracas, comb & paper); Paul McCartney (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, piano, harpsichord, Hammond organ, bass, comb & paper); Ringo Starr (vocals, harmonica, piano, drums, bongos). Additional personnel includes: Neil Aspinall (tamboura, harmonica); Mal Evans (harmonica, alarm clock); George Martin (piano, harmonium, Wurlitzer organ, organ); Sounds Incorporated (saxophone, French horn, trombone). Engineers include: Geoff Emerick, Malcolm Addey, Ken Townsend. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios and Regent Sound Studio, London, England between December 6, 1966 and April 21, 1967. Includes liner notes by George Martin, Mark Lewisohn and Peter Blake. One of the most famous and influential albums ever recorded, SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND had a huge impact on the music world, signaling the beginning of a new era of sophistication and maturity in rock. The musical experimentation was dynamic and fresh, several tracks were edited to create seamless transitions, and even the visual design was more elaborate than anything previously attempted. Producer George Martin and The Beatles searched for new sounds and studio effects. They added crowd sounds and animal cries from sound-effects recordings, sped up Paul McCartney's vocals in \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" (to make him sound younger), and sustained a single piano chord for 40 seconds to end \"A Day In The Life.\" The orchestrations, scored by Martin, were hailed by critics as bridging the gap between pop and classical music, and many people who had never bought a rock record bought SGT.

Meanwhile, a seemingly supernatural mystery begins to unfold when the \"ghost\" that dwells in Murph's room sends her a mysterious set of coordinates - which lead the curious father/daughter duo to a clandestine underground base housing the remnants of NASA. There, renowned physicist Professor Brand (Michael Caine) has been working with a team of astronauts and scientists to find a new planet capable of sustaining human life. Brand quickly persuades Cooper to pilot a mission that will hopefully carry the seeds of human life to a habitable planet in another galaxy.

More than 3 feet tall and 4 feet wide, the Barbie Dreamhouse has so many amazing features -- three stories, eight rooms that include a carport (car not included) and a home office, a working elevator that fits four dolls or a Barbie doll in a wheelchair, a pool that has a slide descending from the story above, five pieces of transforming furniture, lights, sounds and more than 60 additional accessories, including an adorable puppy, that can all be used to decorate, set the scene and play out so many stories. Plug-and-play design helps keep pieces in place as small hands move around (and make clean up easy for adult hands!). Decorations and furniture for indoor and outdoor settings inspire play from all angles, and the transformations provide two-in-one fun while encouraging flexible action -- the couch turns into bunk beds, the coffee table flips for a bed sized for Chelsea doll (sold separately), the fireplace becomes a home office, the refrigerator turns into an outdoor food stand and the oven houses a barbecue in back. Lights and sounds add even more delightful touches -- the oven lights up and the timer ticks, the stovetop sizzles with the frying pan and whistles with the tea kettle and the toilet makes a flushing sound. Young decorators will have so much fun moving accessories around the house as they explore their personal style and tell all kinds of stories, from daytime to nighttime, indoor to outdoor, Barbie home alone or with a house full of friends and family (dolls sold separately). Pool parties, friend sleepovers, sister bonding, backyard BBQs, birthday, holidays and every day -- there are endless stories to tell and limitless ways to explore living in the Barbie Dreamhouse because with Barbie, anything is possible.

This new adventure takes your crew deep down into the abyss on a search for the fabled sunken land. How far you get depends entirely on how well you work together as a team. Card by card, trick by trick, your search party will discover the challenges that lie ahead and forge a path to Mu. This new version of The Crew has the same innovative cooperative trick-taking mechanic as the highly lauded original game — but with some exciting new surprises! While communication between your crew members is severely limited by your submerged state, it is also critical to your success; finding the hidden land in the murky depths depends not only on winning tricks, but also on carefully negotiating the order in which they are won. If things don’t go as planned, you might just be able to salvage the operation.

Recommended for children 8 and older, this set offers 305 do-it-yourself projects that will give your child an entertaining, concrete education on how electronics work.\nCreate Working Electronic Circuits\nSnap Circuits comes with over 60 pieces to create 305 different electronic projects. The pieces, which include snap wires, a slide switch, a resistor, a microphone, and capacitors, snap together easily onto the included plastic grid--no soldering required. Each piece is numbered and color-coded to make identifying them easy. These components combine to create working circuit boards just like the ones found inside televisions, radios, and other electronic devices.\nSimple, Fun Projects Let Kids Learn While They Play\nWith its easy-to-follow instructions, Snap Circuits gives your child a hands-on education in how electrical circuits run the everyday devices that they're familiar with. They'll also gain valuable lessons in building and in following instructions. The project manuals include large color illustrations and simple directions for each project.\nThe project list includes all of the projects included in the SC-100 set and 204 additional projects, including a photosensitive electronic organ, a lie detector, an AM radio, and a two-finger touch lamp. With these projects, children will experiment with electric switches, integrated circuits, digital circuits, fuses, and the transformation of circuit sounds into other sounds.\nGrow as You Go\nBecause the projects are arranged in order of complexity, kids can build on their skills as they progress through the manual. The lessons start out with a simple electric light and switch project that demonstrates how electricity is turned on and off with a switch. Further along, kids can put together a fire fan symphony, a water-detection alarm, a delayed-action fan, and more.\nDesign Your Own Circuits and Upgrade Your Kit\nOnce children have mastered several of the techniques introduced in this kit, they can use the components to experiment and create their own customized circuits and electronic devices. The Snap Circuits SC-300 can also be upgraded to the Snap Circuits Pro, Snap Circuits Extreme, or SCM-400 with the purchase of a UC-50, UC-70, or UC-100 upgrade kit, respectively. Kids will enjoy additional parts, manuals, and projects that'll take their kit--and their fun--to the next level.\nSnap Circuits SC-300 requires four AA batteries, which are not included.\nWhat's in the Box\nPlastic snap-grid, 32 electrical components, and 2 project manuals.\"\nList Price: $79.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: other_60\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $63.992\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

What the others were in their own dimensional sphere or spheres he dared not try to think. –H.P. Lovecraft, “The Dreams in the Witch House” Elder Sign lets players control investigators who must successfully endure adventures within the museum in order to gather clues, items, and the eldritch knowledge they need to seal the rifts between dimensions and prevent the Ancient One’s arrival. A clever and thematic dice mechanic pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy while investigating the most dangerous exhibits and most terrifying instances of insanity. Elder Sign recreates the Lovecraftian thrills of eerie suspense and mind-numbing horrors in a cooperative game players can finish in one to two hours. Rules, card text, and innovative dice mechanics expertly designed by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror, all blend in a game that’s quick to learn, quick to play, strategic enough to reward frequent replay, and eccentric enough to immerse players in the museum’s supernatural intrigue.\nFrom the Manufacturer\nGilman felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension.

Lovecraft, “The Dreams in the Witch House” Elder Sign lets players control investigators who must successfully endure adventures within the museum in order to gather clues, items, and the eldritch knowledge they need to seal the rifts between dimensions and prevent the Ancient One’s arrival. A clever and thematic dice mechanic pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy while investigating the most dangerous exhibits and most terrifying instances of insanity. Elder Sign recreates the Lovecraftian thrills of eerie suspense and mind-numbing horrors in a cooperative game players can finish in one to two hours. Rules, card text, and innovative dice mechanics expertly designed by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror, all blend in a game that’s quick to learn, quick to play, strategic enough to reward frequent replay, and eccentric enough to immerse players in the museum’s supernatural intrigue.\"\nList Price: $39.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: other_120\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $31.992000000000004\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

From novice to expert, now any home baker can take advantage of our most technologically advanced breadmaker, loaded with menu settings and options for the ultimate in versatility. For a basic bread recipe, simply add in measured ingredients, close the lid, make a selection from the user-friendly LCD control panel, and the Home Bakery Supreme takes care of the rest--baking up a rectangular-shaped 2-pound loaf of bread to perfection. Choose from three crust shades--light, medium, or dark--and from various healthy course settings, such as multigrain, whole wheat, rapid whole wheat, gluten free, salt free, and vegan. Best of all, the machine's timer can be set to delay the end of the baking cycle by up to 13 hours, which makes it possible to wake up to the smell of freshly baked, homemade bread in the morning or to come home to a warm loaf at the end of a long day at the office. The bread maker provides two blades for thorough dough kneading and a higher rise, a large viewing window, an \"on\" indicator light, a start/reset button, and a removable nonstick bread pan for easy cleaning.

Our 12-Cup Coffee Maker brews flavorful coffee that meets the Specialty Coffee Association’s (SCA) Golden Cup standard—whether you’re making a full carafe or a single mug. The fully programmable Coffee Maker has a glass water tank and comes with two brew basket sizes, based on your needs: 2-4 cups (small) or 5-12 cups (large). The podless single-serve option utilizes the smaller brew basket so you can brew directly into a mug without the need for a pod. The included drip tray elevates your coffee mug to prevent splashes during brewing. Need to brew a larger batch? The double-wall, vacuum-insulated thermal carafe holds up to 12 cups (60 ounces) and keeps your coffee hot for lasting enjoyment. With the carafe’s brew-through, pour-through lid, you don’t have to fuss with turning or opening the carafe lid before pouring. The detachable mixing tube pushes coffee as it brews, to ensure the last cup is as delicious as the first. The interactive display screen is easy to use. Simply select the amount you’d like to brew and whether you’d like to brew now or later, then press start. The BetterBrew™ precision technology gets to work, controlling water temperature and brewing time, while the Rainmaker head distributes water evenly over coffee grounds to ignite the bloom cycle for optimum flavor extraction. Our Coffee Maker has a sleek, streamlined stainless steel design that fits under most cabinets and is easy to maintain. The glass water tank can be cleaned by hand and maintained using OXO Brew’s Descaling Solution (sold separately). The carafe and lid are hand wash only. The carafe lid’s mixing tube, removable Rainmaker, drip tray, brew baskets, and coffee scoop are top-rack dishwasher safe. Coffee filter replacements also available. \"\"\nList Price: $299.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: other_207\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $239.99200000000002\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Ingredients go into the bowl, the timer is set, two buttons are pressed and about 30 minutes later 1-1/2 quarts of a frozen confection are ready for consumption. Because the machine doesn't require its bowl to be frozen for hours in a refrigerator's freezer (like less expensive machines that only churn), it can immediately begin making another batch.

This filmed version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a crème de la crème cast, including Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and more. Especially fine is the interplay between Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his schoolmates Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), as well as his protector, the looming Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). The second-half adventure--involving the titular sorcerer's stone--doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel; this is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film. Writer Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus keep the spooks in check, making this a true family film, and with its resourceful hero wide-eyed and ready, one can't wait for Harry's return. Ages 8 and up. --Doug Thomas\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\nFirst sequels are the true test of an enduring movie franchise, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets passes with flying colors. Expanding upon the lavish sets, special effects, and grand adventure of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry involves a darker, more malevolent tale (parents with younger children beware), beginning with the petrified bodies of several Hogwarts students and magical clues leading Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) to a 50-year-old mystery in the monster-laden Chamber of Secrets. House elves, squealing mandrakes, giant spiders, and venomous serpents populate this loyal adaptation (by Sorcerer's Stone director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves), and Kenneth Branagh delightfully tops the supreme supporting cast as the vainglorious charlatan Gilderoy Lockhart (be sure to view past the credits for a visual punchline at Lockhart's expense). At 161 minutes, the film suffers from lack of depth and uneven pacing, and John Williams' score mostly reprises established themes. The young, fast-growing cast offers ample compensation, however, as does the late Richard Harris in his final screen appearance as Professor Albus Dumbledore. Brimming with cleverness, wonderment, and big-budget splendor, Chamber honors the legacy of J.K. Rowling's novels. --Jeff Shannon\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\nSome movie-loving wizards must have cast a magic spell on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, because it's another grand slam for the Harry Potter franchise. Demonstrating remarkable versatility after the arthouse success of Y Tu Mamá También, director Alfonso Cuarón proves a perfect choice to guide Harry, Hermione, and Ron into treacherous puberty as the now 13-year-old students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry face a new and daunting challenge: Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison, and for reasons yet unknown (unless, of course, you've read J.K. Rowling's book, considered by many to be the best in the series), he's after Harry in a bid for revenge. This dark and dangerous mystery drives the action while Harry (the fast-growing Daniel Radcliffe) and his third-year Hogwarts classmates discover the flying hippogriff Buckbeak (a marvelous CGI creature), the benevolent but enigmatic Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), horrifying black-robed Dementors, sneaky Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), and the wonderful advantage of having a Time-Turner just when you need one. The familiar Hogwarts staff returns in fine form (including the delightful Michael Gambon, replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson as the goggle-eyed Sybil Trelawney), and even Julie Christie joins this prestigious production for a brief but welcome cameo. Technically dazzling, fast-paced, and chock-full of Rowling's boundless imagination (loyally adapted by ace screenwriter Steve Kloves), The Prisoner of Azkaban is a Potter-movie classic. --Jeff Shannon\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\nThe latest entry in the Harry Potter saga could be retitled Fast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.\nBut don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action in Goblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet. Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the other Potter films, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation. --Ellen A. Kim\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\nAlas! The fifth Harry Potter film has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix begins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of any HP movie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.\nHarry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaper The Daily Prophet to smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.\nThis film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone. As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is a good movie. --Jordan Thompson\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\nThe sixth installment of the Harry Potter series begins right where The Order of the Phoenix left off. The wizarding world is rocked by the news that \"He Who Must Not Be Named\" has truly returned, and the audience finally knows that Harry is \"the Chosen One\"--the only wizard who can defeat Lord Voldemort in the end. Dark forces loom around every corner, and now regularly attempt to penetrate the protected walls of Hogwarts School. This is no longer the fun and fascinating world of magic from the first few books—it's dark, dangerous, and scary.\nHarry (Daniel Radcliffe) suspects Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) to be a new Death Eater recruit on a special mission for the Dark Lord. In the meantime, Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seems to have finally removed the shroud of secrecy from Harry about the dark path that lies ahead, and instead provides private lessons to get him prepared. It's in these intriguing scenes that the dark past of Tom Riddle (a.k.a. Voldemort) is finally revealed. The actors cast as the different young versions of Riddle (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin and Frank Dillane) do an eerily fantastic job of portraying the villain as a child. While the previous movies' many new characters could be slightly overwhelming, only one new key character is introduced this time: Professor Horace Slughorn (with a spot-on performance by Jim Broadbent). Within his mind he holds a key secret in the battle to defeat the Dark Lord, and Harry is tasked by Dumbledore to uncover a memory about Voldemort's darkest weapon--the Horcrux. Despite the long list of distractions, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) still try to focus on being teenagers, and audiences will enjoy the budding awkward romances. All of the actors have developed nicely, giving their most convincing performances to date.\nMore dramatic and significant things go down in this movie than any of its predecessors, and the stakes are higher than ever. The creators have been tasked with a practically impossible challenge, as fans of the beloved J.K. Rowling book series desperately want the movies to capture the magic of the books as closely as possible. Alas, the point at which one accepts that these two mediums are very different is the point at which one can truly enjoy these brilliant adaptations. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is no exception: it may be the best film yet. For those who have not read the book, nail-biting entertainment is guaranteed. For those who have, the movie does it justice. The key dramatic scenes, including the cave and the shocking twist in the final chapter, are executed very well. It does a perfect job of setting up the two-part grand finale that is to follow. --Jordan Thompson\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I is a brooding, slower-paced film than its predecessors, the result of being just one half of the final story (the last book in the series was split into two movies, released in theaters eight months apart). Because the penultimate film is all buildup before the final showdown between the teen wizard and the evil Voldemort (which does not occur until The Deathly Hallows, Part II), Part I is a road-trip movie, a heist film, a lot of exposition, and more weight on its three young leads, who up until now were sufficiently supported by a revolving door of British Thespis throughout the series. Now that all the action takes place outside Hogwarts--no more Potions classes, Gryffindor scarves, or Quidditch matches--Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Rupert Grint (Ron) shoulder the film almost entirely on their own. After a near-fatal ambush by Voldemort's Death Eaters, the three embark on a quest to find and destroy the remaining five horcruxes (objects that store pieces of Voldemort's soul). Fortunately, as the story gets more grave--and parents should be warned, there are some scenes too frightening or adult for young children--so does the intensity. David Yates, who directed the Harry Potter films Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince, drags the second half a little, but right along with some of the slower moments are some touching surprises (Harry leading Hermione in a dance, the return of Dobby in a totally non-annoying way). Deathly Hallows, Part I will be the most confusing for those not familiar with the Potter lore, particularly in the shorthand way characters and terminology weave in and out. For the rest of us, though, watching these characters over the last decade and saying farewell to a few faces makes it all bittersweet that the end is near (indeed, an early scene in which Hermione casts a spell that makes her Muggle parents forget her existence, in case she doesn't return, is particularly emotional). Despite its challenges, Deathly Hallows, Part I succeeds in what it's most meant to do: whet your appetite for the grand conclusion to the Harry Potter series. --Ellen A. Kim\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II\nThe Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the film all Harry Potter fans have waited 10 years to see, and the good news is that it's worth the hype--visually stunning, action packed, faithful to the book, and mature not just in its themes and emotion but in the acting by its cast, some of whom had spent half their lives making Harry Potter movies. Part 2 cuts right to the chase: Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has stolen the Elder Wand, one of the three objects required to give someone power over death (a.k.a. the Deathly Hallows), with the intent to hunt and kill Harry. Meanwhile, Harry's quest to destroy the rest of the Horcruxes (each containing a bit of Voldemort's soul) leads him first to a thrilling (and hilarious--love that Polyjuice Potion!) trip to Gringotts Bank, then back to Hogwarts, where a spectacular battle pitting the young students and professors (a showcase of the British thesps who have stolen every scene of the series: Maggie Smith's McGonagall, Jim Broadbent's Slughorn, David Thewlis's Lupin) against a dark army of Dementors, ogres, and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter, with far less crazy eyes to make this round). As predicted all throughout the saga, Harry also has his final showdown with Voldemort--neither can live while the other survives--though the physics of that predicament might need a set of crib notes to explain. But while each installment has become progressively grimmer, this finale is the most balanced between light and dark (the dark is quite dark--several familiar characters die, with one significant death particularly grisly); the humor is sprinkled in at the most welcome times, thanks to the deft adaptation by Steve Kloves (who scribed all but one of the films from J.K. Rowling's books) and direction by four-time Potter director David Yates. The climactic kiss between Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), capping off a decade of romantic tension, is perfectly tuned to their idiosyncratic relationship, and Daniel Radcliffe has, over the last decade, certainly proven he was the right kid for the job all along. As Prof. Snape, the most perfect of casting choices in the best-cast franchise of all time, Alan Rickman breaks your heart. Only the epilogue (and the lack of chemistry between Harry and love Ginny Weasley, barely present here) stand a little shaky, but no matter: the most lucrative franchise in movie history to date has just reached its conclusion, and it's done so without losing its soul. --Ellen A.

It's time to create your island: a 4x4 tableau of self-supporting growth, expansion and supply where even the cards you don't need become compost for future gain. OVERVIEW: Earth is an open-world engine builder for 1 to 5 players with simple rules and countless strategic possibilities. With its encyclopedic nature and a near-infinite number of tableau combinations, every single game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections, just as our vast and fascinating world allows us to do! Players will create a self-supporting engine of growth, expansion, and supply by drafting from a deck of over 364 unique cards and strategically placing them in their tableau. STARTING THE GAME - The game begins before the starting hand has even been drafted. Players will receive an Island, Climate, and Ecosystem card during set-up. Using these double-sided cards, each player sows their strategy by selecting one side of the card to place face-up in their play area. The combination of these three cards introduces asymmetry to the game by providing variable starting resources, bonus abilities, and unique end-game scoring objectives. ON YOUR TURN - On their turn, the active player will choose one of four different actions, reaping their major benefits, while all other players welcome the minor benefit. Subsequently, all players activate any cards on their player-board, and in their tableau, which match the color of the chosen action. Players continue taking actions, arranging their Island, sowing Plants and developing Terrains to attract elusive Fauna, and unlock the scoring bonuses of diverse Ecosystems. TRIGGERING END GAME - Once a player has added a sixteenth card to their 4×4 tableau, they earn a completion bonus and trigger the end of the game. All players will tally the victory points they earned from completing Ecosystems, reaching Fauna objectives, Composting cards, gaining Plant cubes and Growth pieces, for their Plant and Terrain values and for Events played. The player with the most victory points wins! Game Playtime (min): 45.

                "content": "Inventory List:\nProduct1\nCodename: other_250\nTitle: \"Breville Smart Oven Toaster Oven, Brushed Stainless Steel, BOV800XL\"\nDescription: \"Every Breville product begins with a simple moment of brilliance. The Breville Smart Oven began with the simple fact that different foods require different methods of heating: some, like baked goods, need to be cooked evenly; others, like meats, need to be seared on top. Most toaster ovens fail to distribute heat in a consistent way throughout their interiors, let alone change heat distribution to suit the different foods being prepared. This is how the Breville Smart Oven stands apart: whatever the food, it adjusts its heat distribution for perfect results. The Smart Oven is equipped with Element IQ cooking technology, which adjusts the power of the five individual quartz heating elements to cook food more evenly and quickly. This sophisticated heating system distributes heat throughout the oven when and where it is needed, to guarantee more efficient cooking. Nine different menu options allow users to choose the best setting for the food they are cooking. In addition to dynamically distributing heat to different areas, the Smart Oven can adjust the wattage of its heating elements for even more cooking flexibility. Most ovens have elements with fixed wattage that can only switch between ON and OFF, but Element IQ functions much like a dimmer on a light switch, increasing or decreasing element power with a simple turn of the knob. For example, broiling requires high heat from above in order to melt and brown, so the Smart Oven activates 1500W of high heat from the top elements of the oven. On the other hand, toast needs to be cooked evenly on both sides without drying out the inside, so the Smart Oven uses high radiated heat from above and below (1800W distributed between four elements) to crisp the outside quickly. Baking utilizes another feature of the Smart Oven that contributes to even heating: convection heating. Convection cooking uses a fan to circulate hot air so all sides of the food cook at the same rate. This is particularly important for baked goods, such as cookies and cakes, which need to be cooked evenly all the way through. Each of these nine functions is preset with recommended settings, taking the guesswork out of cooking. However, each can be customized according to recipe, volume of food, or personal taste. Customized settings will remain in the memory of the oven until changed or until the oven is unplugged from the wall outlet, streamlining your cooking process. The Smart Oven is carefully constructed from the most durable materials. It is attractively housed in Reinforced stainless steel, a striking addition to any kitchen. The elements themselves are composed of quartz, rather than the metal elements found in other toaster ovens. Quartz responds more quickly to heat change, which results in more even heating throughout the oven. The roomy interior is coated with a non-stick material that can safely withstand high temperatures, making cleanup easier. A crumb/drip tray that is accessible from the front of the oven (rather than the back, like many other toaster ovens) also makes it easier to clean between cooking sessions. In addition, the oven includes a patented magnetic auto-eject rack: small magnets embedded on the sides of the oven door pull the wire rack halfway from the oven when the door is opened, making food easier to remove and preventing burns. At 18.5 x16.25 x11.25 inches, the Breville Smart Oven is not too small but not too large. It is larger than most toaster ovens, with space to comfortably fit six slices of toast, a 13-inch pizza, or a whole Chicken. However, as a countertop convection oven, it is more space-efficient than a conventional wall oven. A smaller oven means less time to heat up and less time to cook, perfect for preparing a meal in a hurry (or for cooks who like to create in the heat of the moment). This also translates into a cooler kitchen (particularly convenient in the hot summer months) and less energy consumed.\"\nList Price: $299.95\n\nShopping List\ncodename: other_250\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $239.96\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

If it starts heating without enough water in the unit, the heater will automatically shut off to avoid damaging the heating element. The lights will flash and the unit will beep to alert you. Once the kettle has cooled down, lift it off the base, then replace it to reset and restart the heating cycle. The quickest way to cool down the heater is to fill the kettle with cold water; however, you can also wait for it to cool down by itself. ; Sleep Mode If the unit is not in use for 5 minutes, it will revert to sleep mode. The heater and all lights will be off, but your last selections will remain in the unit’s memory. To turn the kettle back on, simply press any button, or lift it up and then return it to the base.\"\nList Price: $99.95\n\nShopping List\ncodename: other_251\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $79.96000000000001\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

It comes with a robust 6.0Ah high-capacity Power Share battery and a wider 8-in. cutting width to mow up to a 1/8 acre. You’ll never have to cut your lawn again once you set up your Landroid. Just place the charging base, lay the boundary wire around the perimeter of your lawn and secure it with pegs, and finish setup on the handy Landroid App. You can even control Landroid and schedule mowing times from the App, without ever getting off your couch. It’s packed with cutting-edge tech to ensure it does a good job and leaves you with a lawn you can be proud of. The patented AIA (Artificial Intelligence Algorithm) allows it to navigate narrow passages with ease (something other robotic mowers have trouble with). And its Floating Blade Disc automatically raises the blades when Landroid encounters uneven terrain, so it doesn’t get trapped or stuck. Plus, it’s powered by a high-efficiency brushless motor that runs 50% longer, is 25% more powerful, and offers 10% longer life compared to mowers with brushed motors. The Landroid S is the next generation of robotic lawn mowers, with more performance and functionality to take on bigger yards.\"\nList Price: $999.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: patio-lawn-garden_3\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $799.9920000000001\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Its patented AIA technology lets it mow in a random algorithm and navigate narrow passageways with ease. The Landroid is also weatherproof and comes equipped with a rain sensor that lets it know to head back to the charging base so it doesn’t mow wet grass. The convenient mobile app allows you to control Landroid from the palm of your hand and suggests an auto schedule to best fit your lawns size and conditions. Landroid mows more frequently than other mowers, its offset razor-like blades cut a little off the top during every mow cycle and mow closer to the perimeter of the lawn. When the battery gets low Landroid knows to head back to its charing base to rest and recharge. Each wheel is driven by an independent brushless motor that gives it more maneuverability and helps it to navigate obstacles and slopes up to 20°. Select from 5 cutting height adjustments from 1.9”-3.5” with the turn of a knob. Landroid is also customizable with a full line of accessories to meet the unique needs of your lawn. Give Landroid a home with the Landroid garage, keep it away from unexpected obstacles with the Anti-Collision System, or exclude seasonal items from its mowing area with Off Limits.

Whether you have flies, fruit flies, moths, or gnats, you can count on this trap for effective insect control. Simply place in any outlet near where you’ve noticed insect activity, and it will immediately begin to attract and trap insects. Its versatile design allows you to plug it into any standard outlet and rotate the trap as needed. The trap is the ideal choice for homes with children and pets. The Safer Home Indoor Plug-in Fly Trap generates UV LED light which naturally draws in a wide variety of flying insects. Once insects are drawn in by the light, they get stuck fast to the StickyTech Glue Cards, where they are securely held until the time of disposal. Trapped insects are hidden on the back of the StickyTech Glue Card, so you and your guests never have to see them. Each trap provides up to 400 square feet of coverage so even large rooms are protected. The Safer Home Indoor Plug-in Fly Trap was designed with ease of use in mind. Simply peel the backing off the StickyTech glue card and insert it into the trap. Plug the trap into a standard outlet near common insect hotspots, including near houseplants, exterior doors, pet areas, in kitchens, bedrooms, and other areas of your home. Allow the trap to run continuously for 24/7 protection. The trap is also reusable. Replacement StickyTech Glue Cards are available for continued protection from insects.\"\nList Price: $17.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: patio-lawn-garden_5\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $14.392\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

The C-anchor stake is a purpose-built plastic anchor stake that has a loop which secures both 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch tubing with barbs on the stake itself that anchor it firmly in the soil. The loop anchor stakes/staples come in 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch versions and are very similar to traditional landscape fabric stakes. They work best for firmer soils which provide some grip on the wire. While the C-anchor stake provides a more secure hold in a wider variety of soils, the wire loop anchor stakes provide the dual benefit of holding drip tubing and landscape fabric in place. Each of the anchor stakes is reusable and provides years of reliable service.

This layer increases the panel's energy generation by boosting efficiency.\nHalf-Cell architecture improves shade tolerance, ensuring better electrical performance over conventional modules.\nCompared with a standard 5-Busbar design, the 10-Busbar design reduces the impact of microcracks and minimizes the cell gap to ensure performance and increase the module's efficiency.\nHigher Efficiency\n- Renogy's 550W monocrystalline solar panel provides an average of 2200-2750 Watt-hours (Wh) power per day (depending on sun availability).\n- It has passed the strict electroluminescence (EL) test without any microcracks. No hot spots.\nMore Power, Less Space\n- Engineered with industry-leading technologies, this high-powered 550W solar panel provides maximum power generation for your limited roof space.\n- It's an economical long-term investment for utility-scale systems, solar power plants, residential and commercial applications.\nCorrosion-Resistant Aluminum Frame\n- Corrosion-resistant aluminum frame design ensures the solar panel survives in harsh outdoor environments, including the burning sun and heavy rain.\n- Provides an extended period of work time without damage or loss of performance.\nPre-Drilled Holes for Easy Installation\n- Renogy solar panels are equipped with back frame and ground mounting holes, ready for installation.\n- They are easy to mount and secure, ideal for off-grid, on-grid, and hybrid solar systems.\nExtreme Weather Endurance\n- Withstand up to 5400 Pa of heavy snow load and up to 2400 Pa of high wind.\n- Provide excellent durability in a harsh environment.\nExtended Durability\n- IP68 rated waterproof junction box and solar connectors ensure that water and dust will not enter during extended outdoor use.\n- The built-in bypass diodes protect the solar cells from overheating, allowing the solar panel to perform during accidental shading by bypassing the underperforming cells.\n550W Monocrystalline Solar Panel 50in Tilt Mount Brackets 320W Monocrystalline Solar Panel 450W Bifacial Solar Panels 550W Bifacial Solar Panels 800W 12V Monocrystalline Solar Kit\nMaximum Power 550 Watt 50 inch 320 Watt Bifacial 450 Watt Bifacial 550 Watt 800 Watt\nItem Dimensions 89.7 x 44.6 x 1.4 in 50 x 1.97 x 0.98 in 65.6 x 39.4 x 1.4 in 75.2 x44.6 x 1.4 in 91.73 x 47.24 x 1.4 in 41.8 x 20.9 x 11.2 in\nItem Weight 62.8 lbs 7.20 lbs 39.7 lbs 50.9 lbs 67.85 lbs 125.3 lbs\nFAQ\n1.Q:Is each panel 550 Watt or a whole combination? What about the size and weight?\nA:550 Watt per panel. The dimension of one panel is 89.7 x 44.6 x 1.4 inches, and the weight is 62.8 lbs.\n2.Q:How many kWh a day does this solar panel produce?\nA:If your solar panels are exposed to 5 hours of direct sunlight per day, it can provide an average of 2200-2750 Watt-hours (2.2 kWh - 2.75 kWh) of electricity (depending on sun availability).\n3.Q:Why choose this high-powered 550 Watt module rather than 5-6 100 Watt solar panels?\nA:High-powered solar panels are primarily used for utility-scale systems, solar power plants, solar farms, residential and commercial applications. Compared with 100 Watt solar panels, these high-powered 550 Watt modules provide maximum power generation for your limited roof space. They also allow the use of fewer mounting systems, including wiring cables, screws, or mounting brackets.\n4.Q:Can these panels be used on a grid-tied system?\nA:Sure, they can. These high-powered 550 Watt solar panels work with on-grid, off-grid, and hybrid systems. But please note that when using them on on-grid and hybrid systems, we recommend that you contact a licensed solar installer familiar with on-grid/hybrid setups.On-Grid solar system means solar power equipment (array or solar panel) is connected to the utility grid.Off-Grid solar system refers to a system that is not connected to the grid.An Off-Grid system is not affected by grid blackouts. A Hybrid system is when your solar panels remain connected to the grid's power lines and have a backup battery system to store excess power.\n5.Q:How should I connect solar panels to my electrical circuit (series vs parallel)?\nA:Solar panels can be connected in series or in parallel to meet your electrical circuit size and power needs.Connecting solar panels in series, the operating voltage output will add up while the current output will remain the same as a single solar panel.When connecting solar panels in parallel, the operating current output will add up while the voltage output will remain the same as a single solar panel.To meet your power system's optimum power output and system rating, you can use parallel and series connections. Please note that we recommend connecting the solar panels with the same open circuit voltage.\n6.Q:Do these panels have pre-drilled holes on the back?\nA:Yes, they have. The pre-drilled holes help you to install the solar panel quickly and securely.\n7.Q:Can this solar panel be adapted to a 12V Marine Battery or 48V Lithium Battery?\nA:Yes, it can. The optimum operating voltage of this 550W solar panel is 41.97V. So it's suitable to use for charging your 12V Marine Battery and 48V Lithium Battery (by connecting at least two solar panels in series). Please note that you need to connect the solar panel(s) to a Charge Controller supporting a 12V or 48V system.\"\nList Price: $2626.85\n\nShopping List\ncodename: patio-lawn-garden_9\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $2101.48\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

That's why each of our Churu Lickable Creamy Purée Natural Cat Treats are made from high-quality ingredients, including wild-caught tuna and farm-raised chicken. Since cats are not naturally drawn to water, we have made these a high-moisture, low calorie cat treat that your kitties will love. They contain 91% moisture and have only 6 calories per tube. That's a tenth of the calories of traditional dry cat treats and more than 1000 times the moisture (8% vs. 91% moisture). In addition, we've also added Taurine to help with their vision, digestions and heart health, as well as, Vitamin E for immunity and Green Tea Extract for its natural antioxidants. What they're missing? They're grain-free, preservative-free, carrageenan-free and free from artificial colors, making them a cat treat you can feel good about feeding. Designed to be hand fed, you can use to help calm the feistiest of outdoor ferals or treat your pampered indoor pussycat. They can be used a dry/canned cat food topper or to assist with giving medications. Available in 19 savory flavors, you'll be able to find a flavor that your kitty will crave no matter what stage of life they are (kitten to senior). Inaba Churu makes snack time fun for you and your feline friends.\"\nList Price: $39.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: pet-supplies_4\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $31.992000000000004\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Unlike traditional toilet paper that can often be rough and ineffective, the WASHLET quickly provides comfortable warm water cleansing at the touch of a button. Part of the newly redesigned C Series, the WASHLET C5 is fully automated, featuring a soft rear spray, rear cleanse, and front cleanse with the option of an oscillating or pulsating stream. The controls are located on a slim, wireless remote. The PREMIST function sprays the bowl with water before each use, preventing waste buildup and keeping the toilet bowl clean. The C5 model utilizes TOTO's EWATER+ system when the wand self-cleans. EWATER+ uses electrolyzed water generated by a technologically advanced process, transforming the water into a safe and powerful compound. This cleaning technology helps to keep create peace of mind by cleaning the inside and outside of the wand before and after every use. The C5 WASHLET features a heated SoftClose seat with five temperature settings, an air deodorizer, and a warm air dryer with five temperature settings. Using a WASHLET reduces the need for toilet paper, saving trees and water used to manufacture each roll. As we get older, reduced mobility, medical conditions, and debilitating illnesses can make it increasingly hard to clean ourselves after using the toilet. With a WASHLET, just the touch of a button can leave you feeling clean and refreshed.

Unlike traditional toilet paper that can often be rough and ineffective, the WASHLET quickly provides comfortable warm water cleansing at the touch of a button. A once mundane trip to the bathroom can become a spa-like experience with the addition of a WASHLET. The TOTO WASHLET K300 features instantaneous water heating with five spray settings for front and rear washing, including an optional oscillating or pulsating stream. Equipped with a comfortable heated seat, warm air dryer, and a deodorizer to neutralize odors and enhance your overall experience. The illuminated remote control can be handheld or mounted to the wall for convenient use. The K300 prevents toilet bowl waste buildup by using TOTO's advanced PREMIST technology that sprays the bowl before every use to keep it clean. The new K300 model utilizes TOTO's EWATER+ system when the wand self-cleans. EWATER+ uses electrolyzed water generated by a technologically advanced process, transforming the water into a safe and powerful compound. This cleaning technology helps to keep create peace of mind by cleaning the inside and outside of the wand before and after every use. The WASHLET reduces the need for toilet paper, thus conserving trees and water used to manufacture each roll. As we get older, reduced mobility, medical conditions, and debilitating illnesses can make it increasingly hard to clean ourselves after using the toilet. With a WASHLET, just the touch of a button can leave you feeling clean and refreshed.

The variable speed dial allows you to set the optimal speed for the routing task and material.

Microfine bit depth adjustment systems on both bases allow for accurate and fast bit depth adjustments. The microfine adjustment has an overall range of one inch and is accurate to 1/64 inch.\nBoth bases also feature the Bosch Precision Centering Design, which allows the bit to be centered with the subbase or optional template guides (sold separately). This makes it easier than ever to keep the bit on the intended cutting-line when using guidance devices such as jigs, templates, or dovetail fixtures.\nBoth of the included bases, fixed and plunge, feature quick clamp systems for quick tool-free conversions, so moving the motor between the two bases takes only seconds and requires no tools. The plunge base features soft grip handles for easier operation, and the fixed base includes threaded holes for mounting it to router tables. The fixed base's advanced bit height adjustment system allows you to conveniently adjust the bit height from above the router table.\nRugged Design for Increased Durability\nThe Bosch 1617EVSPK Plunge and Fixed-Base Router Kit is durable and built for years of use. The motor housing and bases are now made of aluminum, and the power switch is now completely dust-sealed for added durability. The rugged carrying case keeps all of the components protected.

You can even set push notifications to alert you when entering peak zones.\nInstallation\nInstalling Sense is a straightforward process that generally takes a licensed electrician less than 30 minutes to complete. Two sensors clip around the service mains that connect your electrical panel to the grid.\nMonitor Two Circuits Directly\nIn addition to Sense’s machine learning device detection and smart plug integrations, you can monitor up to two 120V or 240V circuits directly with dedicated circuit monitoring. Using optional locking Flex add-on sensors, it’s perfect for large loads and critical devices like your HVAC system, EV charger, or variable speed pool pump.\nSense FLEX Home Energy Monitor Sense Home Energy Monitor Sense SOLAR Home Energy Monitor\nWhat is it?

Setup is easy as the Kidde carbon monoxide alarm plugs into a standard, 120V AC power outlet in your home, while a 9-volt alkaline battery (included) works as a backup in the event of a power failure. When carbon monoxide is detected, the digital display shows the level of carbon monoxide the alarm is sensing and updates every 15 seconds. Peak Level Memory records the last time carbon monoxide was detected or when the unit was tested. The Smart-Hush button silences the unit for approximately 8 minutes, which is helpful when this smoke detector carbon monoxide detector combo sounds from things like routine cooking or shower steam. Extension cord (included) allows for placement on a table or shelf. Install a carbon monoxide smoke detector combo on every level of your home and near bedrooms to help keep your family safe. UL Certified with a 10-year limited manufacturer's warranty. Meets requirements of UL 2034, UL217, NFPA72, (chapter 11 2002 edition) The State of California Fire Marshal, NFPA101 (One and two family dwellings) Federal Housing Authority (FHA), Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\nAmazon.com\nProtect your family from the dangers of carbon monoxide (CO), methane, and propane exposure with the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk Plug-In Carbon Monoxide and Explosive Gas Alarm. The Nighthawk is an easy-to-install unit that provides reliable protection against the dangers of CO and explosive gas. The digital display shows if gas is present indicates CO levels in parts per million, allowing you to see if, how, and when levels change.\nAdvanced Technology in an Easy-to-Install, Plug-In Design\nDesigned for home use, the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is a UL-listed, A/C-powered, plug-in alarm that utilizes sophisticated electronic components and sensor technology to protect you and your family from the dangers of CO, methane, and propane exposure. It plugs directly into a standard A/C outlet and includes a 9-volt battery backup that provides continuous monitoring--even during power outages.\nThe Dangers of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Propane Exposure\nThe leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, carbon monoxide (CO) is often referred to as the silent killer because it's odorless, tasteless, and invisible. Carbon monoxide poisoning can come about via a number of sources, including everyday items and appliances in your home or office. And because symptoms of CO poisoning mimic the flu or other common illnesses it can often go undiagnosed.\nLikewise, methane and propane gases are commonly used in homes for cooking, heating, and water heating. Although it happens rarely, gas leaks can sometimes occur inside the home, increasing the risk of fire or explosion.\nAudible Alarm Pattern Alerts you to Elevated CO and Gas Levels\nWhen placed on every level of your home, alarms like the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk can help protect everyone in the house by giving you an unmistakable signal when gas levels have reached an unhealthy point. If unhealthy levels of CO are detected, the alarm will emit four quick audible beeps every five seconds until either levels decrease or the reset button is pressed. If methane gas or propane gas is detected, the alarm will emit beeps every other second with \"GAS\" shown in the display.\nEasy-to-Read Digital Display Shows CO Levels\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is preferred among traditional CO and explosive gas alarms because of its digital display. This display clearly shows levels of CO that the unit has detected and stored-- from 30 to 999 ppm--and it updates every 15 seconds to indicate any abrupt changes or alarming trends. The display also shows the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged. The continuous display also shows if gas is present.\nLED Shows Sensor Status\nWith the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk, you never have to wonder if the sensor is functioning properly. A blinking dot in the lower right-hand corner of the display denotes normal operation, so you can trust that it's working. In addition, you can test alarm function by pressing the test/reset button at any time to verify that the horn and electric circuitry are operating properly.\nConvenient Mounting Options\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a low-profile design that makes it suitable for any room in your home. The detector can be plugged into any standard A/C outlet; it's plug can be snapped into the back of the unit and can be rotated so the alarm remains vertical, independent of whether the electrical socket is mounted vertically or horizontally. In addition, the alarm comes with a 6-foot extension cord, so the unit can be plugged into the wall outlet and then placed on a table or shelf. For the most thorough protection, place an alarm on every level of your home.\nThe UL-listed Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a seven-year life and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.\nAbout Kidde: A UTC Fire and Security Brand\nRenowned for global leadership in fire detection and suppression, Kidde provides solutions ranging from portable fire extinguishers to advanced industrial controls such as flame detection and explosion suppression systems.

The Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff is a smart home water security system that provides 24/7 protection by monitoring for water leaks—some as small as one drop of water per minute—and other vulnerabilities, no additional sensors needed. Designed by plumbing and tech industry professionals, Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff is installed on the main water supply line of the home. Through the Moen Smart Water App you can see live water use, including water flow rates, pressure and even temperature. If the Smart Water Shutoff detects an issue (e.g. high pressure, freezing water, or a small leak) it will alert you through the App, or other preferred notification methods, so you can assess the issue before it causes costly damage. If there is a catastrophic failure, like a burst pipe or someone leaves the water running, you will be alerted in the App allowing you to shut the water off remotely—no matter where you are. If you fail to respond to the alert or are on vacation, the device can be set to automatically shut off water to help limit damage and loss.\"\nList Price: $687.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: tools-home-improvement_114\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $550.392\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.
