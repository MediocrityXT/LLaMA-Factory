Mayan Orange: Hot and intense! Use it straight from the tube for a blazing red-orange. As you add water, the color remains strong and disperses very evenly.\nUltramarine Blue: Intense, pure and subtly granulating, it stands proudly alone pure blue without shading to any other color. Cobalt Blue: Power with every drop. Cobalt Blue is a neutral, non-staining primary blue which subtly modifies most pigments. Considered a “mixing pigment”, its transparent nature can cast a giant reticulating shadow.\nViridian: This transparent non-staining pigment is an excellent glazing pigment. It’s a cool blue-green useful in mixing without staining other pigment particles and for soft edges. Yellow Ochre: Is a stunning gold hue, bright and clean yet true to its earthy nature. It s non-staining, can be lifted easily to create highlights and has a predicable soft granulation in washes .\nBurnt Sienna Light: ”DANIEL SMITH has created Burnt Sienna Light just for me. It is a beautiful, transparent hue. It is permanent, it has power and it breaks down Ultramarine Blue perfectly. Burnt Sienna Light is fabulous when you want to place cool colors on top. I use it when I am going into my darks where I drop it into Ultramarine Blue (included in the set) or Alizarin Crimson to create magnificent darks” -Alvaro.\"\nList Price: $243.54\n\nShopping List\ncodename: arts-crafts-sewing_22\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $194.832\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Two-year unlimited mileage warranty, labor included and no commercial exceptions.\nFrom the Manufacturer\nMotorcraft filters are engineered to the high quality standards of the Ford Motor Company and are recommended by Ford as the original equipment replacement filter for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles. They are designed to help protect against engine wear by screening out abrasives, such as carbon, sand, dust and bits of metal before they can get into your oil. Pressure-relief valves help minimize the chance of contaminated oil circulating back into the engine and also help maintain the supply of oil to the engine under extreme cold conditions or if the filter gets clogged. The outer casings are constructed of steel, “ironed” for a precise fit, painted to resist rust and include flutings to ease removal. The efficient filter media offers increased dirt-collecting capability and ability to capture more engine-harming particles. Silicone anti-drain back valves help prevent oil from draining out of the filter and engine when the engine is not running and resist the aging effects that an engine’s high heat can cause.\"\nList Price: $12.0\n\nShopping List\ncodename: automotive_3\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $9.600000000000001\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Better than that, it offers six different preset heat settings, which allows for steeping tea at just the right temperature depending on the variety. Using the simple one-touch controls on the kettle's handle, select 160 degrees F for delicate teas, 175 degrees F for green tea, 185 degrees F for white tea, 190 degrees F for oolong tea, 200 degrees F for French press coffee, and \"Boil\" for black tea or to make instant cocoa, oatmeal, noodles, and more. Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp Cordless Programmable Kettle The control panel also offers blue LED indicators, a \"start\" button, and a \"keep warm\" button, which will maintain the set temperature for 30 minutes. For added convenience, the kettle's 360-degree swivel base allows for pouring without the hassle of a power cord getting in the way, and its memory function makes it possible to remove the kettle from its base for two minutes without it shutting off or losing its place in the heating process. Other highlights include a stay-cool nonslip handle, an \"open\" button for lifting the lid, a blue backlit water window with measurement marks, a concealed heating element to prevent mineral buildup, a removable/washable scale filter, a dripless pour spout, and boil-dry protection with auto shutoff for safety. A user manual with recipes comes included. The kettle measures approximately 8-1/5 by 9-4/5 by 12 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty. Parts and Benefits.

When returned to the base, it will restart the heating and/or Keep Warm cycles right where they left off. Keep Warm Mode Keep Warm is the kettle’s default function that automatically maintains selected temperature for 30 minutes. If you have selected the Boil preset, your unit will hold a temperature just below boiling during the Keep Warm cycle. To bring water back to a rolling boil, press the Start button twice. Keep Warm can be turned off by pressing the Keep Warm button at any time before or during the heating cycle. ; Boil-Dry Protection Your kettle is equipped with boil-dry protection. If it starts heating without enough water in the unit, the heater will automatically shut off to avoid damaging the heating element. The lights will flash and the unit will beep to alert you. Once the kettle has cooled down, lift it off the base, then replace it to reset and restart the heating cycle. The quickest way to cool down the heater is to fill the kettle with cold water; however, you can also wait for it to cool down by itself. ; Sleep Mode If the unit is not in use for 5 minutes, it will revert to sleep mode. The heater and all lights will be off, but your last selections will remain in the unit’s memory. To turn the kettle back on, simply press any button, or lift it up and then return it to the base.\"\nList Price: $99.95\n\nShopping List\ncodename: home-kitchen_41\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $79.96000000000001\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Storing produce in a plastic bag or crowded crisper limits airflow and enables moisture buildup, creating prime conditions for rotting. Each Produce Keeper uses all-natural, activated Carbon Filters to trap and absorb ethylene, a gas emitted by fruits and vegetables that accelerates the ripening process. Along with the Carbon Filter, the GreenSaver Produce Keeper’s unique construction keeps food fresher longer. A removable basket promotes airflow and prevents moisture buildup by keeping produce away from the bottom and sides of the container. A vent on the lid slides open and closed to optimize the humidity level for the produce being stored. An illustrated guide on the lid shows which fruits and vegetables thrive when humidity is higher (vent closed) and which ones keep best when the humidity is lower (vent open). The 5 Qt Produce Keeper ids great for carrots, cucumbers, celery, kale, scallions and more. The GreenSaver Produce Keeper is BPA free and dishwasher safe. The 5 Qt Produce Keeper comes with one enhanced Carbon Filter. Each Filter lasts up to 90 days, at which point it will no longer have the capacity to absorb more ethylene. Filter refills are sold separately. To sign up for reminders to replace your filter, or to learn more about the OXO GreenSaver line, visit www.greensaver.oxo.com.\"\nList Price: $29.77\n\nShopping List\ncodename: home-kitchen_65\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $23.816000000000003\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Cooks 3 to 10 times faster than ordinary cooking methods - even faster than a microwave for many foods. Chicken, fish, meat and vegetables cook to perfection fast. Helps tenderize economical cuts of meat. Works on regular and smooth-top ranges. Cover lock indicator shows when there is pressure inside the cooker and prevents the cover from being removed until pressure is safely reduced. Includes a special rack for cooking several foods at once with no intermingling of flavors. Dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Liquid capacity: 4 quarts. Do not use this pressure cooker for pressure frying with oil (3.8 liters).\nAmazon.com\nPressure cookers have experienced renewed popularity over the last several years because cooks have rediscovered what some cooks (particularly grandmas) have known for a long time--they're really fast. And it's easy to cook healthfully with pressure cookers, since the food retains so much more of its nutrients and flavor. Presto's 4-quart stainless steel pressure cooker is a multi-purpose pot that can stand in as a conventional saucepan as well as perform the kitchen magic that pressure cookers are famous for. Chicken Cacciatore cooks in 8 minutes! This professional-quality stainless steel pressure cooker is a handy addition to any well-rounded set of kitchen tools.\nThe heavy-duty lid locks down during cooking; an inner sealing ring keeps the steam in. In addition to a pop-up pressure indicator and a simple steam release mechanism, there is an overpressure plug that will let off steam if it builds up excessively. This pressure cooker is useful for weeknight dinners or for any meal that needs to come together quickly. An accompanying booklet contains more than 65 recipes, ranging from basic soup stocks to stews and pot roasts--even desserts like 5-minute custards! Tenderize lean cuts of beef or pork; or cook chicken, fish, or vegetables faster than you can in a microwave, and without losing moisture.\nNonabrasive cleansers are best for cleaning this stainless steel pressure cooker, though occasional use of a fine metal polish will help the exterior keep its shine. The Presto 4-quart pressure cooker is fully immersible; in addition, the sealing ring should be removed after each use to allow cleaning of the inside rim of the lid. The vent pipe is simple to keep clean with a small brush or pipe cleaner, and both the air vent/cover lock and the overpressure plug are removable. The pressure cooker measures 9 inches in diameter (16-1/2 inches including handles) and 6-1/2 inches tall (including lid). Presto guarantees this pressure cooker with an extended 12-year warranty. A detailed instruction and recipe booklet is included; special safety issues that pertain to pressure cookers are clearly explained. --Garland Withers\"\nList Price: $74.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: home-kitchen_238\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $59.992\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Some people even used the spin cycle of their washing machine to dry lettuce. Our easy-to-use Spinner transformed the tool into an everyday kitchen essential. Nearly 20 years later, we revisited the Spinner to make some updates while keeping the top features and original inspiration: a children’s top. With a modern design that complements contemporary kitchens and an improved brake that stops on a dime every time, we think you’ll love our new spin on the classic design. Dry salad greens with a simple press of the soft, non-slip knob. The non-slip base keeps the bowl steady on the countertop, and the updated built-in brake button stops the Salad Spinner for unloading. The basket doubles as a colander, and the lid comes apart for easy cleaning.\"\nList Price: $30.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: home-kitchen_314\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $24.792\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Ingredients go into the bowl, the timer is set, two buttons are pressed and about 30 minutes later 1-1/2 quarts of a frozen confection are ready for consumption. Because the machine doesn't require its bowl to be frozen for hours in a refrigerator's freezer (like less expensive machines that only churn), it can immediately begin making another batch. If a batch becomes too hard the machine shuts off automatically. Not only does it work professionally it looks the part, as the housing, bowl, and paddle are made of stainless steel for sanitation and easy cleaning.

From summertime campouts to Sunday night dinners, Lodge is happy to be at home on your table.\n17 INCH SEASONED CAST IRON SKILLET WITH 2 LOOP HANDLES\nThe Lodge 17 inch Seasoned Cast Iron Skillet offers both elegance and versatility for your kitchen and campsite.

Use it for simple one-pan meals, or complex family recipes. This skillet translates beautifully from the kitchen to the table as you make every meal a memory. Lodge allows you to take cast iron places it’s never been before.\nCOOKING AND CARING FOR YOUR CAST IRON\nCaring for your cast iron doesn’t have to be complicated. Lodge cookware comes already seasoned and ready to use, so you can make your family's favorite recipes right away. You can use it on any heat source, from the stove top to the campfire (just not the microwave). The more you use it, the better the seasoning will get.\nAfter hand washing your cookware, simply place it on a burner for a few minutes to dry and then rub on a thin layer of the cooking oil of your choice. For extra messy situations, simmer some water in your pan and then use a pan scraper after it’s cooled. For excellent maintenance, and to prevent rust, always dry promptly and store in a cool, dry place.\nMADE IN THE USA\nTucked between the Appalachian Mountains and the Tennessee River you’ll find the small town of South Pittsburg, TN; a town that Lodge is proud to call home. It’s built on family values, American history, and high quality cookware. All Lodge seasoned cast iron and carbon steel cookware is proudly made in the USA, meaning you’ll get the craftsmanship that has been passed down through generations.Care -If the seasoning on your pan is sticky, this is a sign of excess oil building up and not fully converting to seasoning. To remedy this, place the cookware in the oven, upside down on the top rack and bake at 400 degrees for 1 hour. Allow to cool and repeat if necessary.

Cuisinart's Metal Classic Toaster has a smooth brushed stainless housing with polished chrome and black accents. Its custom controls let you defrost and toast bagels and bread -- just the way you want them Press any of the four buttons, bagels, reheat, defrost and cancel, to fit your toasting needs. The browning control sets the desired toast color from light to dark, with six browning levels. Product Features Smooth brushed stainless housing with polished chrome and black accents Custom control: 6-setting browning dials, dual reheat, defrost and bagel buttons with LED indicators 1-1/2-inch wide toasting slots Extra-lift carriage lever Slide-out crumb tray Convenient cord wrap Instruction book Limited 3-year warranty Toasting Tips Toasting is a combination of cooking and drying of the bread. Therefore, differences in moisture level from one bread to another can result in varying toasting times. For slightly dry bread, use a lower setting than you normally would. For very fresh bread or whole wheat bread, use a higher setting than normal. Breads with very uneven surfaces (such as English muffins) will require a higher toast setting. Thickly cut pieces of bread (including bagels) will take longer to toast, sometimes significantly longer, since more moisture must be evaporated from the bread before toasting can occur. Very thick pieces may require two cycles. Cleaning and Maintenance Always allow the toaster to cool completely before cleaning. Do not use abrasive cleansers. Simply wipe the exterior with a clean damp cloth and dry thoroughly. Apply any cleansing agent to a cloth, not to the toaster, before cleaning. To remove crumbs, slide out the crumb tray and discard crumbs. Wipe clean and replace. Never operate the toaster without the crumb tray in place. To remove any pieces of bread remaining in the toaster, turn the toaster upside down and gently shake. Never insert any hard or sharp instruments into the slot, as this could damage the toaster and cause a safety hazard. Never wrap the cord around the outside of the toaster. Use the cord storage cleats on the underside of the toaster. Product Dimensions The Cuisinart 2-Slice Metal Classic Toaster measures approximately 10.75\" x 7.13\" x 7.13\". The 4-Slice Metal Classic Toaster measures approximately 11.15\" x 10.65\" x 7.5\". Warranty The Cuisinart Metal Classic Toaster has a limited 3-year warranty. Do not touch hot surfaces.

Since that time, AprilAire continues to lead the industry in whole home humidification systems. Our evaporative humidifiers work by piping water into the distribution tray located at the top of the humidifier. The water is uniformly distributed across the width of the tray and through a scientifically designed system of outlets. It flows by gravity over the Water Panel evaporator. Dry, hot air from the HVAC system is moved through the moisture-laden Water Panel evaporator. Natural evaporation takes place, the water is turned to vapor, and the humidified air is circulated throughout your home.\n\nINCLUDED IN THE BOX: Installation instructions and template, humidifier with built-in bypass damper, 24 VAC transformer, manual humidifier control with sensor, saddle valve, solenoid valve, and Model # 35 Water Panel\nFrom the Manufacturer\nThe Aprilaire Model 600M Whole-House Humidifier features a built-in bypass damper, which means fewer parts to install. The bypass damper is conveniently labeled for both summer and winter settings, allowing you to set it for the entire season with no guesswork involved.

Flavors don't mix, and there's no need to rotate the trays. It's top-mounted fan eliminates the worry of liquids dripping into the heater chamber, and an opaque Vita-Save exterior helps block harmful lights in order to retain more of the food's nutrients and vitamins during the drying process. The unit's adjustable thermostat ranged from 95 to 160 degrees F, providing the flexibility needed to ensure excellent results. It's a 600 watts unit. Five trays come included, but can be expanded to 12 trays (additional trays sold separately) for drying larger quantities. Accessories include two fruit roll sheets, perfect for drying semi-liquids like soups, sauces, and fruit rolls; two Clean-A-Screen flexible screens, which allow for easy drying of small items such as herbs, spices and potpourri; and three original jerky spice packets for making jerky.

Drying is one of the most important steps in the hand washing process, and how you dry matters. Forced air dryers and hot air dryers can take two or even three times as long to use as a paper towel. Studies show that while the overall cost per use is comparable, the likelihood of spreading germs is greatly reduced with the use of absorbent, single-use drying towels, such as white Kleenex® Hard Roll Paper Towels. Germ counts are significantly lower following the use of a touch-free paper towel dispenser (like the compatible Kimberly-Clark Professional™ Hard Roll Paper Towel Dispenser)—as much as a 200% decrease when compared with using either jet or hot air dryers. And, rather than blowing germs into the air during use, the paper towels are thrown neatly away. These paper towel rolls offer terrific hand drying performance, so your guests will waste less. A healthy workplace is a happy workplace, and providing high-quality Kleenex® Hard Roll commercial paper towels to your guests, clients and employees is one important piece of the puzzle.\"\nList Price: $81.49\n\nShopping List\ncodename: industrial-scientific_15\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $65.192\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Made with incredibly strong, permanent, butyl adhesive and a weather resistant shell, this tape withstands even extreme weather conditions. Gorilla All Weather Tape resists drying, cracking, and peeling caused by sunlight, heat, cold, and moisture and works in both hot & cold temperatures. Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. That’s it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! For best results, apply to a clean surface free of dust, dirt, and debris. Great for tarps, plastic sheeting, roofs, vents, RV's, and all general purpose heavy duty repairs. Gorilla All Weather Tape contains a highly concentrated rubber based adhesive and sticks to most plastics, including polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Gorilla All Weather Tape does not work on materials with high oil or plasticizer content, such as EPDM rubber or PVC. An acrylic tape, such as Crystal Clear Gorilla Tape, may be better suited for these materials. Gorilla All Weather Tape should NOT be used as an electrical tape.

Developed for long-lasting repairs in an instant, the clear glue dries in 10-45 seconds. This super glue gel is specially formulated to absorb drops and impacts. Super glue, also referred to as cyanoacrylate glue, or CA glue, works on a variety of materials, including plastic**, metal, stone, ceramic, paper, rubber and more. In addition to its high-performance formula, we've added an anti-clog cap with a metal pin inside to ensure an airtight seal for maximum reusability. It's Gorilla tough, every time.\n\n*Versus liquid Gorilla Super Glue\n**Not recommended for use on polyethylene or polypropylene plastic or similar materials.\n\nDirections:\n1) Protect Work Area From Spills\n2) Clean and Dry Surfaces to Be Bonded\n3) Prepare Gorilla Super Glue Gel: With cap on bottle, shake product, then turn product upside down and tap on hard surface to shake gel into bottle nozzle.\n4) Apply Gorilla Super Glue Gel: Remove cap and apply a small amount of Gorilla Super Glue Gel to one surface. Only one dab per square inch recommended. Set time can vary based on the amount of glue and type of surface glued. Excess glue can cause delayed or failed bond.\n5) Secure: Press the two surfaces together for about 10-45 seconds. Note that gaps and uneven surfaces may cause delayed bonding. Wait 24 hours for a full cure.\n\nBottles are labeled by weight, not by volume, and each bottle contains the labeled weight. For high performance and reusability, the glue needs to be protected from moisture. Our bottle, which has the required thickness to keep moisture out, contains the grams of glue as labeled and is flexible enough to allow the glue to flow, making the product easy to use.\"\nList Price: $11.3\n\nShopping List\ncodename: industrial-scientific_21\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $9.040000000000001\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

We speculate about an America ruled by Jefferson Davis, a Europe that never threw off Hitler, or a second term for JFK. These narratives are often written off as politically inspired fantasy or as pop culture fodder, but in Telling It Like It Wasn’t, Catherine Gallagher takes the history of counterfactual history seriously, pinning it down as an object of dispassionate study. She doesn’t take a moral or normative stand on the practice, but focuses her attention on how it works and to what ends—a quest that takes readers on a fascinating tour of literary and historical criticism.\n\nGallagher locates the origins of contemporary counterfactual history in eighteenth-century Europe, where the idea of other possible historical worlds first took hold in philosophical disputes about Providence before being repurposed by military theorists as a tool for improving the art of war. In the next century, counterfactualism became a legal device for deciding liability, and lengthy alternate-history fictions appeared, illustrating struggles for historical justice. These early motivations—for philosophical understanding, military improvement, and historical justice—are still evident today in our fondness for counterfactual tales. Alternate histories of the Civil War and WWII abound, but here, Gallagher shows how the counterfactual habit of replaying the recent past often shapes our understanding of the actual events themselves. The counterfactual mode lets us continue to envision our future by reconsidering the range of previous alternatives. Throughout this engaging and eye-opening book, Gallagher encourages readers to ask important questions about our obsession with counterfactual history and the roots of our tendency to ask “What if…?”\nRead more\"\nList Price: $36.1\n\nShopping List\ncodename: kindle-store_4\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $28.880000000000003\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Remastered edition of Oasis' classic debut album. 'In 20 years' time, people will buy DEFINITELY MAYBE and listen to it for what it was. That's what is important.' Noel Gallagher, August 1994. Remarkably confident words from a guitarist on the eve of his band's debut album release. But Oasis were always certain in their abilities - and the public were just as clear the five-piece were on the right track. Let's get the statistics out of the way. On it's release in August 1994, DEFINITELY MAYBE sold a record-breaking 86,000 copies in it's first week, the highest first-week sales for a debut album in Britain. It has since gone on to sell 5 million around the world. Over the course of their eight albums until disbanding in 2009, Oasis sold over 70 million albums. More importantly, the songs sound as fresh and relevant today as they did 20 years ago. A hunger to escape will always sound vital, especially if it's sung as mesmerically as Liam Gallagher and written with the urgency of Liam's older brother Noel.\"\nList Price: $39.22\n\nShopping List\ncodename: music_4\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $31.376\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Warner Classics’ new 33-CD box set, to be released in January, stands as the first and only complete collection of recordings of Debussy’s music. It comprises all his known works, including six pieces in world-premiere recordings made especially for this edition. Compiled in collaboration with renowned Debussy expert Denis Herlin (Editor-in-Chief of the complete critical edition of Debussy’s music for Durand, the composer’s publisher), Debussy: The Complete Works comprises recordings carefully chosen for their artistic quality and their authenticity of spirit, with the invaluable addition of a bonus album of recordings made by Debussy himself – he was a superb pianist. Other superb musicians featured in this collection include Martha Argerich, Itzhak Perlman, Yehudi Menuhin, Daniel Barenboim, Kent Nagano, Sir Simon Rattle, and the crème de la crème of the French school, from Aldo Ciccolini, Samson François and Gérard Souzay to Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Philippe Jaroussky, Roberto Alagna, Natalie Dessay and Quatuor Ebène. + Read more This complete edition brings together all Debussy’s known works. The one work that is not currently available is the orchestral version of anIntermezzocomposed in June 1882. However, it is possible to form an idea of how this might have sounded thanks to Debussy’s own transcription of the piece for piano duet (7/5). The following works can be heard here in premiere recordings: theChanson des brises(1882) for soprano solo, female chorus and piano four-hands (24/12), the complete manuscript of which has recently come to light; the first version (1898) of the twoChansons de Chansons de Charles d’Orléans(25/5-6); Diane au bois(1885-87), a “comédie lyrique” for soprano, tenor and piano (26/1); the beginning ofLa Chute de la maison Usher, as it was when Debussy set the work aside in 1916 (30/6-15); To this group of works, we have added the piano reductions ofKhamma(4/13) – whose orchestration was mainly the work of Koechlin – and ofJeux(4/14), both of which provided the basis on which the choreography of the two ballets was devised. Moreover, some of Debussy’s transcriptions from the 1890s have never been recorded until now: À la fontaine, an arrangement for piano solo ofAm Springbrunnenfrom Schumann’s Op.85 set of piano duets (6/9); Humoresque en forme de valse, an arrangement for piano solo of Raff’sHumoreske in Walzerform, op.159, for piano duet (6/10); Saint-Saëns’ Symphony No.2 andAirs d’Étienne Marcel, arranged for two pianos, four hands (11/8-18); In addition to the above, we have included several arrangements of Debussy’s works made by composers with whom he was on friendly terms. The complete edition contains all the transcriptions by André Caplet (for piano solo, two pianos and orchestrations), even those carried out after Debussy’s death. Caplet’s orchestrations of two of theAriettes oubliées(22/13-14) are recorded here for the first time. Most of Caplet’s transcriptions received Debussy’s seal of approval, and the composer conducted the orchestral version ofChildren’s Corner(18/14-19) on several occasions and took part in performances of the two-piano version of Ibéria (10/5-7). The same applies to the arrangements made by Henri Busser, Jean Roger-Ducasse, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht and Bernardino Molinari. Ravel’s transcriptions and orchestrations are testimony to his admiration for Debussy. Finally, it is worth noting that Debussy was on good terms with the violinist Arthur Hartmann and transcribedMinstrels, one of the pianoPréludes, for his f\"\nList Price: $89.98\n\nShopping List\ncodename: music_7\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $71.98400000000001\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Although »Even The Score« was not followed by another studio album, Rhett did not stop recording new music, collaborating with various musicians in different bands and projects over a period of six years until his untimely death in 1994. Two of them can be heard on »The Canadian Years«. Dr. Dirty (the group was initially called Mr. Dirty but the name was changed to Dr. Dirty because of the use of two D's for a logo) was the brainchild of guitarist Rob Robins. He explains: \"Scot Gaines on bass and myself had been writing for almost a year when we ran into Rhett Forrester in Calgary. He had just finished his time with Rick Plester's Black Symphony. We were looking for a singer to do some gigs with. Rhett's name was brought up and we had a meeting with him, and it seemed like a great fit! We immediately played him the songs we had been working on. Rhett was always great in the studio getting his parts down. Totally pro. No matter what we would throw at him, Rhett always delivered a great performance.\" The actual demo sessions for Dr. Dirty took place from 1992 through to early 1993. Rob Robins: \"We did four songs in Calgary: 'Red Bone Rock', 'Smoking Gun', 'In And Out' and 'Coming Home'. In LA we did 'Rescue Me', 'Hold On', 'Love Song' and 'Too Little Too Late'. Originally we had some interest from a label just when the project split up.\" Probably one of Rhett Forrester's most unusual contributions had come in 1992 (just before the Dr. Dirty sessions) in the form of The Black Symphony (consisting of the three songs \"In The Beginning\", \"Redemption\" and \"End Of Time\"). Black Symphony was the baby of Canadian guitarist Rick Plester, who explains: \"I wrote all the material for The Black Symphony's five record history pretty much. I placed ads in magazines all over North America for a lead singer and Rhett Forester answered. When he phoned me out of the blue, I was pleasantly surprised because I had been a fan of Riot before. A few weeks later we flew Rhett up to Calgary in Canada where I was living at the time. Days after his arrival we recorded three songs at a studio in Calgary. Rhett was very entertaining, he was fun to be around. I enjoyed his friendship. He was very driven and brought lots to the table. It was sad in the end I had to let him go due to his issues with drugs and burnt bridges.\"1. Coming Home 2. Redbone Rock 3. Love Song 4. Rescue Me 5. Too Little Too Late 6. Smokin' Gun 7. Hold On 8.

When plugged in without accessories, the Flower Fountain provides a gently flowing water surface. Inserting the flower accessory creates long, faucet-like streams of water. The flower is easy to add to (or remove from) the fountain. Adding the flower cap will tone down the bubbling water on top, so give this setting a try if your cat would rather play with the water than drink from it. The Flower Fountain includes a Triple Action Filter to help prevent urinary tract diseases. The Catit Triple Action filter removes magnesium and calcium from tap water. These minerals can accumulate in your pet’s lower urinary tract and lead to urinary tract diseases, a common health issue for cats. Active Carbon removes odors and impurities, and retains stray hairs, sediment and debris. The Flower Fountain is easy to disassemble and clean and has an ergonomic design matching the Catit Multi Feeder. Combine the two for a complete dining experience! The Catit Flower Fountain is compatible with the Catit Senses 2.0 Water Softening Filters. Low power usage. Catit is focused on creating cat enrichment toys for all cats especially indoor cats. Cat toys for indoor cats should encourage a cat’s natural foraging and hunting behaviors. Our Catit Senses 2.0 line has created a wide variety of cat toys, with this in mind. To keep your cat interested, you need to change their toy set-up often, Catit Senses 2.0 is the only interactive cat toy series that allows you to create new and exciting setups for your cat, quickly and easily! Each toy was designed to activate and stimulate your cat’s unique senses, all in one fresh, green style to match any home interior, no matter the arrangement.\"\nList Price: $37.05\n\nShopping List\ncodename: pet-supplies_31\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $29.64\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

It helps with more signs of stress, in more situations, and calms cats better than ever; it may help reduce scratching, urine spraying (peeing), tensions & conflicts among cats, general fears, and reactions to changes. This new discovery, backed by FFELIWAY's 25+ years of feline stress expertise, delivers advanced calming messages, helping your cats feel more comfortable at home than ever before. When surveyed, 93% of cat owners reported enhanced calming for their cats when using FELIWAY Optimum. This product contains 6 refills for the FELIWAY Optimum diffuser (diffuser head not included). FELIWAY Optimum's heated diffuser and refill provide calming pheromones continually for up to 30 days in a 700 square foot area. We recommend using an additional diffuser if the room is bigger than 700 square feet. We recommend plugging in the FELIWAY Optimum diffuser in the room where you cat spends the most time, or where conflict among your cats happen most frequently. Try not to plug the diffuser under items (e.g. shelves) or close to objects (e.g. behind curtain or doors) as this affects efficacy. We do not recommend plugging your diffuser in near your litterbox or in a hallway - while your cat may frequent these places, they likely do not spend as much time in these places as you'd think. If your litterbox is in the room where your cat spends the most time, you will want to plug your diffuser into that room. Use FELIWAY Optimum each month to create a constant calming environment. Check the diffuser and refills monthly; you'll want to replace the refill each month, and replace the diffuser head twice a year (every six months) to guarantee the best effect. Make sure to only use a FELIWAY Optimum diffuser with a FELIWAY Optimum Refill. The diffuser is not compatible with refills from other brands, and the FELIWAY Optimum vial should not be used with other diffusers. Never use a diffuser or refill of another brand with a FELIWAY product. Each FELIWAY Diffuser comes with a plug adapted to the local electric systems. Please do not use this diffuser in another country that has a different voltage or with an adapter: it may conduct serious security concerns. Make sure that your diffuser has the fitting plug for your country before plugging in.\"\nList Price: $120.0\n\nShopping List\ncodename: pet-supplies_40\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $96.0\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

The 18V LXT 5.0Ah battery (BL1850) is compatible only with star protection tools, indicated by the Star Symbol and/or Yellow Battery Receiver under the tool.

This advanced charging technology helps optimize battery life and deliver a faster charge. In addition, the Charger has a built-in fan to cool the battery for faster and more efficient charging, even in hot weather conditions. For improved tool performance and extended battery life, Makita created STAR Protection Computer Controls.

The powerful 4V Screwdriver from Worx provides 300 rpm of no-load speed for a max hard torque of 44 in-lbs, and a max soft torque of 22 in-lbs. Yet, this tool is only 1.5 lbs itself, feels great in the hands, and is easy to hold from multiple angles and in varied positions to get at tough to reach fasteners. Getting a manual screwdriver into a tight space isn’t usually the problem, but generating enough torque once you get it in there usually is. With this Worx automatic screwdriver, all you have to do to generate max torque is hold down a button. The 4V motor is as powerful as some drills, and you’ll get about 45 minutes of no-load working time on a single charge. But because you’re likely to use this tool in short bursts, it will effectively last much longer than 45 minutes. Plus, it charges back up in only an hour and a half. This model comes with a box full of bits. That’s the other advantage of auto screwdrivers: you just need one and a few bits, instead of a dozen separate tools. This tool is covered by a 3-year limited warranty because we’re confident in the longterm performance of our tools. Take a step to improving the longterm performance of your hands with the 4V Screwdriver from Worx. You’ll notice the benefits immediately and still feel them well down the road.\"\nList Price: $49.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: tools-home-improvement_80\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $39.992000000000004\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Three Knife, Two Speed Thickness Planer is powered by a 15 Amp motor to easily manage large cuts in wider materials. Three-knife cutter head with 10,000 rpm and feed speed options for 96 or 179 CPI provide optimal performance.\nAmazon.com\nThe DEWALT DW735 features a three-knife cutterhead and a powerful 15 amp motor that delivers 10,000 rpm. It offers quick, accurate depth adjustment and the convenience of knives that are both reversible and disposable. This fully featured portable planer makes it easy to create clean custom stock.\nPowerful 15 Amp Motor for Clean Cuts\nBenchtop planers are a long-term investment that allow you to save money over time by buying rough stock and dimensioning it yourself. They also make creating custom materials easier, which, in turn, makes getting great results easier.\nThe DW735 13-Inch Planer's powerful 15 amp motor can handle deep cuts in tough hardwoods. Its three-knife cutterhead and two-speed gearbox deliver 96 or 179 cuts per inch (cpi). Use 96 cpi when dimensioning material and 179 cpi for a finer finish.\nReversible, Disposable Knives for Convenience\nThe DEWALT DW734 uses razor sharp knives that are reversible and disposable. These knives last 30 percent longer than traditional disposable knives, helping you avoid costly and time-consuming resharpening.\nFor fast, easy, one-tool knife changes, a set of pins machined on the cutter-head goes through holes machined on the knife. This helps you quickly locate the fresh knife and refasten the knife clamp.\nLarge Capacity and Easy, Accurate Depth Adjustment\nThis planer's extra-long infeed and outfeed tables provide 33-1/2 inches of material support. A turret depth stop saves you time when setting the machine at commonly used depths.\nIn addition, the planer's material-removal gauge and extra-large thickness scale help ensure every pass is accurate. A four-column carriage lock drastically reduces the movement that causes material damage, or snipe, when planning near the end of a board.\nThis sturdy planer weighs 80 pounds. It offers a maximum cut depth of 1/8 inch, a depth capacity of 6 inches, and a width capacity of 12-1/2 inches.\nFan-Assisted Chip Ejection for Dust Management\nThe DW735 features a Fan-Assisted Chip Ejection System with a motorized fan that breaks down debris as it leaves the cutterhead and blows it into one of the two dust shrouds (included). One shroud disperses the chips down onto the shop floor while the other provides a connection for a vacuum hose or dust-collector hose.\nThis sturdy planer weighs 92 pounds. It offers a maximum cut depth of 1/8 inch, a depth capacity of 6 inches, and a width capacity of 13 inches.\nThe DW735 13-Inch Thickness Two-Speed Planer with Three-Knife Cutterhead also comes with a DEWALT warranty package that includes a three-year limited warranty, a one-year free service contract, and a 90-day money-back guarantee.\nWhat's in the Box\nDW735 DEWALT 13-Inch Thickness Two-Speed Planer with Three-Knife Cutterhead, dust-hose adapter, and dust-ejection chute.\n\n\n\n\nSee more\"\nList Price: $1120.0\n\nShopping List\ncodename: tools-home-improvement_83\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $896.0\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

There, he and his cutlers’ union produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professionals and home cooks. Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier’s Knife and Officer’s Knife. After the death of his mother, and with the advent of stainless steel, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born. Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.\"\nList Price: $60.61\n\nShopping List\ncodename: tools-home-improvement_161\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $48.488\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

In doing so, the booster pump optimizes every aspect of the reverse osmosis process from production speed to drain ratio.\nOur products are tested annually to remove up to 99.99% of harmful contaminants that commonly appear in municipal and well water. All filters, tanks, tubing and other water-contacting parts are manufactured to comply strictly with NSF/ANSI standard (58 for reverse osmosis).\nThe RCC7P-AK has earned an international mark of product quality from one of the most recognized and trusted drinking water treatment programs in the world. All of our systems go through rigorous testing for air leaks, pressure and cycle resistance to maintain our own premium quality and high performance standards.\n\nThe electric booster pump ensures reliable, consistent performance regardless of pressure variations. This allows the system to achieve up to 50% faster tank fill rates with up to 50% less water waste.\nArsenic & Barium & Cadmium\nArsenic & Barium & Cadmium\nCopper & Lead & Iron & Manganese\nFluoride\nRadium (226/228)\nAnd more...\nPrecision Performance\nThe RCC7P-AK is a pressure-boosted, multi-layered filter system that provides optimal protection against over 1,000 different types of contaminants, including arsenic, asbestos, chlorine, fluoride, lead, mercury, sodium, and more. Boosting the water pressure improves the performance of the Reverse Osmosis filter stage increasing water production speed and reducing waste water. This is essential when the home water pressure is low (below 40 PSI).\n3 Pre-filters: PP sediment filter. Carbon KDF (GAC) filter. Carbon block (CTO) filter. They remove large contaminants and protect the RO membrane from chemicals like chlorine and chloramines.\nThe heart of the system is the Reverse Osmosis (RO) filter that removes contaminants down to 0.0001 microns – so small that only water molecules can squeeze through but virtually nothing else.\nFine GAC filter provides final polishing before the purified water is delivered to the faucet.\nAn Alkaline Remineralization filter restores healthy minerals and a natural alkaline balance, while also producing a more natural taste.\nThe end result is great-tasting bottled-water quality.\nReinforced Transparent 1st Stage Housing\nProvides an easy way to visually inspect the sediment filter and view the contaminants being removed from your water. With the transparent housing you will know it is time for a filter change before a problem occurs.\nFinest Micron, Layered Protection\nThe advantage of having both 5-micron GAC & CTO filters is that loose carbon (GAC, KDF) is better at trapping large contaminants, leaving only smaller ones to the CTO carbon block filter. This allows the CTO filter and RO membrane to function at their maximum efficiency and last longer.\nLeak-Free System & Online Supporting Videos\nPush to connect fittings and color coordinated tubings simplify the installation process.

Using a manual screwdriver can strain your hands pretty quickly, and everyone drops fasteners and bits on the ground. Eliminate those two problems with this semi-automatic driver and bit changer—with a screw holder built right in. You just press the orange button on the tip to get the jaws to accept the screw. Then with just one hand, you can maneuver into tight spaces and drill it home. The jaws work when you need to back screws out, too. Your six favorite bits are stored onboard, and you cycle between them by shifting the top piece back towards you. With 0-230 revs/min of no-load speed, you’ll have enough torque to handle the most common screwdriver applications. And the LED headlamp lets you see what you’re doing, even in the dark. The internal 4V battery will hold a charge for up to 18 months, so you can toss the SD Driver on a shelf and it’ll be ready to go the next time you pick it up. A charger comes with it, as does the reloadable bit cartridge, which is stocked with 6 of the most common bits already. Save your hands and stop losing bits and fasteners. Get screws into places you never thought possible before. The SD Driver with Screw Holder is a solution to a couple of problems that come with using a regular screwdriver. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about those anymore.\"\nList Price: $61.57\n\nShopping List\ncodename: tools-home-improvement_179\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $49.256\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Filtrete Premium Allergen, Bacteria & Virus Air Filters help capture unwanted particles from your household air, contributing to a cleaner, fresher home environment. By proactively capturing dust, bacteria, viruses and allergens, these high performance filters help improve your home’s air quality.\nAmazon.com\nThe Filtrete 1900 MPR Ultimate allergen reduction filter not only vastly improves the air quality in your home, it also keeps your air conditioning and heating systems running efficiently, saving on utilities and maintenance costs. The electrostatic filter attracts and captures airborne dust, pollen, dust-mite debris, lint, mold spores, pet dander, smoke, smog, bacteria, particles that can carry viruses, and particles that can carry odors. With each pass through the specially pleated filter, the air in your living space improves, making for a healthier home environment. This high-performance filter outperforms comparable non-electrostatic fiberglass and washable and reusable one-inch filters.\n\n1900 MPR Ultimate\nAllergen Reduction Filter\nAt a Glance:\nElectrostatic filter attracts and captures dust, pollen, dust-mite debris, mold spores, pet dander, smoke, smog, bacteria, particles that can carry viruses, and particles that can carry odors\n\nImproves air quality by cleaning air with each pass through the filter\n\nKeeps your furnace or air conditioner running efficiently\n\nOutperforms comparable fiberglass and washable/reusable filters\n\nPack includes six filters\n\nBy removing dust from the air, the filter also reduces strain on your furnace and air conditioner, helping to keep them running efficiently (view larger).Electrostatic Design Captures More Particles\nThe 3M Ultimate allergen reduction filter is made with both positively charged and negatively charged fibers that act like tiny magnets to attract air-polluting contaminants. Since particles in the air are either positively or negatively charged, they are attracted to and captured by the filter and kept out of your living space.\nElectrostatic filters, including the 3M Ultimate allergen reduction filter, perform better than comparable non-electrostatic fiberglass and washable/reusable filters, because they attract and capture the small, allergy-aggravating microparticles that non-electrostatic filters can't.\nImproves Indoor Air Quality\nWith indoor air a surprising two to five times more polluted than outdoor air, the 3M Ultimate allergen reduction filter can make a difference in maintaining a healthier home environment by cleaning air with each pass through the filter.\nThe 3M Ultimate allergen reduction filter features a 1900 Microparticle Performance Rating (MPR), which means it is able to capture large and small particles from the air, including household dust, pollen, dust-mite debris, mold spores, pet dander, smoke, smog, bacteria, particles that can carry viruses, and particles that can carry odors. This high-performance filter meets American Lung Association of the Upper Midwest Health House Program’s indoor air quality guidelines.\nImproves Efficiency\nThis high-performance allergen-reduction filter also keeps your heating and air conditioning equipment working efficiently by removing dirt and reducing strain on the motor. It is recommended that you change the filter every three months. However, the effectiveness and life of the filter can vary and depend on the individual conditions in your home.\nAbout Filtrete Air Filters\nFor nearly 25 years, Filtrete filters have delivered cleaner air to millions of homes, becoming a leader in residential air filtration. Developed by 3M engineers to help capture airborne allergens, the Filtrete filter media is electrostatically charged to act like tiny magnets to attract and capture microscopic particles from the air as it passes through the filter. Today, a dedicated technical team continues to develop innovative filtration solutions for around the home, including air cleaning filters, room air purifiers, and water filtration products.\nWhat's in the Box\nPack of six 3M 1900 MPR Ultimate allergen reduction filters.\n\nFiltrete Air Filtration Products\nElite Allergen Reduction Filter\nUltimate Allergen Reduction Filter\nUltra Allergen Reduction Filter\nMicro Allergen Reduction Filter\nDust and Pollen Reduction Filter\nDust Reduction Filter MPR Rating 2200 1900 1500 1000 600 300 Dust Pollen Dust Mite Debris Lint Pet Dander Smoke & Smog Bacteria Particles Carrying Viruses Particles Carrying Odors\"\nList Price: $161.54\n\nShopping List\ncodename: tools-home-improvement_281\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $129.232\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.
