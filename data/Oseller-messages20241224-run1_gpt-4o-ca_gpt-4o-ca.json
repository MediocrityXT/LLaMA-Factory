Mayan Orange: Hot and intense! Use it straight from the tube for a blazing red-orange. As you add water, the color remains strong and disperses very evenly.\nUltramarine Blue: Intense, pure and subtly granulating, it stands proudly alone pure blue without shading to any other color. Cobalt Blue: Power with every drop. Cobalt Blue is a neutral, non-staining primary blue which subtly modifies most pigments. Considered a “mixing pigment”, its transparent nature can cast a giant reticulating shadow.\nViridian: This transparent non-staining pigment is an excellent glazing pigment. It’s a cool blue-green useful in mixing without staining other pigment particles and for soft edges. Yellow Ochre: Is a stunning gold hue, bright and clean yet true to its earthy nature. It s non-staining, can be lifted easily to create highlights and has a predicable soft granulation in washes .\nBurnt Sienna Light: ”DANIEL SMITH has created Burnt Sienna Light just for me. It is a beautiful, transparent hue. It is permanent, it has power and it breaks down Ultramarine Blue perfectly. Burnt Sienna Light is fabulous when you want to place cool colors on top. I use it when I am going into my darks where I drop it into Ultramarine Blue (included in the set) or Alizarin Crimson to create magnificent darks” -Alvaro.\"\nList Price: $243.54\nCost: $32.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

This system, which features the new and improved Wireless ONE system, packages the components of the compressor system into one easy-to-install package. The manifold and air compressor are pre-assembled at the factory in a black, powder-coated steel mounting plate. This plate helps to protect the vehicle by requiring no frame drilling. The system easily attaches to the vehicle frame rail through the use of a removable U-bolt, making the entire on-board air compressor system a no-drill application. Without EZ Mount, the manifold and compressor must be mounted to the frame of the vehicle individually and then routed together. This process leaves room for error and frustration. By securing the components together, Air Lift is able to factory-test and ensure that they system will be free from leaks, as well as provide a much simpler installation process. Buying a compressor system with EZ Mount helps to greatly reduces installation time by up to one hour and comes with a fully illustrated and easy to understand installation manual. Backed by Air Lift's industry-exclusive two-year limited and 60-day, no-questions-asked, money-back , it's a system you know you can trust. As the leader in air suspension products for more than 65 years, Air Lift is committed to delivering quality load support parts that last. Take your load support solution to the next level today with EZ Mount!\"\nList Price: $675.95\nCost: $364.46\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Raptor/Lightning) 5' 7\" Bed (67.1\")\"\nDescription: \"The BAKFlip MX4 was the first matte-finished, hard folding cover to market, becoming America’s #1 Selling Hard Folding Cover in just a few years. Simply put, the MX4 just looks better than other covers. Its sleek no-profile appearance allows you to maintain the appearance of your truck, while enabling you to securely stow cargo in the bed. The MX4’s pioneering, textured matte-finish adds a premium look and feel while also protecting against UV damage, annoying finger print marks, and scratches. MX4 has everything you expect from a premium cover. The engineers at BAK Industries fine-tuned even the smallest elements of the cover, down to adding cab corner caps and rail-end cap, to extending a matte-finish throughout the cover’s side rails, clamps, and elevator bolts. The MX4’s integrated buckle system and automatic latching mechanism allows you to drive with the cover partially or fully opened without covering the 3rd brake light. For 100% bed access, simply unlock the cover from either side via its pull latches and fold the cover all the way up against the cab. From there, you can prop the cover in place by tightening two rods into the underside of the panel. For enhanced durability, the MX4 also features pre-molded, shock-absorbent bumpers on either side of the panel, protecting the folded panels from hitting the cover during turbulent driving. Rain or shine, the MX4 provides confident cargo storage that’s complete with dual drain tubes to divert water away from the truck bed, as well as full perimeter seals to help protect against water intrusion. Finally, the MX4 can hold up to 400lbs of evenly distributed weight and is backed by a 5-year, hassle-free warranty. BAKFlip MX4 is proudly made in the USA with globally sourced materials with a US-based support team. .\"\nList Price: $1299.99\nCost: $817.4\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

So not only does it look great, it’s built to protect your iPhone from scratches and drops.\nThe FineWoven material may show wear over time as the fibers get compressed with normal use. Some scratches may diminish over time. Interaction with MagSafe accessories will leave slight imprints.

HERITAGE Since 1882, our salt has been made with the same traditional artisan methods. Salt markers born and bred, we’ve been hand harvesting our world famous salt flakes from the coastal town of Maldon since 1882. FAMILY BUSINESS Our salt works are run by the 4th generation of the Osborne family. UNIQUE QUALITY Our soft crunchy flakes are loved by the chefs and aspiring cooks the world over. Seawater is carefully harvested on the spring tides every two weeks. There’s an art in temperature and timing which is our family secret. Using our unique traditional methods, we hand harvest our flakes to ensure they are simply perfect in both taste and texture. DISTINCTIVE SHAPE Our curious pyramid crystals have always been our company trademark. So much of the flavor of sea salt is in the shape of the crystals and the way they are experienced on the tongue. Maldon’s flakes release their saltiness with sweet precision and add another layer of texture and crunch. They are tactile and best served by taking a generous pinch and crushing between fingers and thumb.

Better than that, it offers six different preset heat settings, which allows for steeping tea at just the right temperature depending on the variety. Using the simple one-touch controls on the kettle's handle, select 160 degrees F for delicate teas, 175 degrees F for green tea, 185 degrees F for white tea, 190 degrees F for oolong tea, 200 degrees F for French press coffee, and \"Boil\" for black tea or to make instant cocoa, oatmeal, noodles, and more. Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp Cordless Programmable Kettle The control panel also offers blue LED indicators, a \"start\" button, and a \"keep warm\" button, which will maintain the set temperature for 30 minutes. For added convenience, the kettle's 360-degree swivel base allows for pouring without the hassle of a power cord getting in the way, and its memory function makes it possible to remove the kettle from its base for two minutes without it shutting off or losing its place in the heating process. Other highlights include a stay-cool nonslip handle, an \"open\" button for lifting the lid, a blue backlit water window with measurement marks, a concealed heating element to prevent mineral buildup, a removable/washable scale filter, a dripless pour spout, and boil-dry protection with auto shutoff for safety. A user manual with recipes comes included. The kettle measures approximately 8-1/5 by 9-4/5 by 12 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty. Parts and Benefits.

When returned to the base, it will restart the heating and/or Keep Warm cycles right where they left off. Keep Warm Mode Keep Warm is the kettle’s default function that automatically maintains selected temperature for 30 minutes. If you have selected the Boil preset, your unit will hold a temperature just below boiling during the Keep Warm cycle. To bring water back to a rolling boil, press the Start button twice. Keep Warm can be turned off by pressing the Keep Warm button at any time before or during the heating cycle. ; Boil-Dry Protection Your kettle is equipped with boil-dry protection. If it starts heating without enough water in the unit, the heater will automatically shut off to avoid damaging the heating element. The lights will flash and the unit will beep to alert you. Once the kettle has cooled down, lift it off the base, then replace it to reset and restart the heating cycle. The quickest way to cool down the heater is to fill the kettle with cold water; however, you can also wait for it to cool down by itself. ; Sleep Mode If the unit is not in use for 5 minutes, it will revert to sleep mode. The heater and all lights will be off, but your last selections will remain in the unit’s memory. To turn the kettle back on, simply press any button, or lift it up and then return it to the base.\"\nList Price: $99.95\nCost: $51.04\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Storing produce in a plastic bag or crowded crisper limits airflow and enables moisture buildup, creating prime conditions for rotting. Each Produce Keeper uses all-natural, activated Carbon Filters to trap and absorb ethylene, a gas emitted by fruits and vegetables that accelerates the ripening process. Along with the Carbon Filter, the GreenSaver Produce Keeper’s unique construction keeps food fresher longer. A removable basket promotes airflow and prevents moisture buildup by keeping produce away from the bottom and sides of the container. A vent on the lid slides open and closed to optimize the humidity level for the produce being stored. An illustrated guide on the lid shows which fruits and vegetables thrive when humidity is higher (vent closed) and which ones keep best when the humidity is lower (vent open). The 5 Qt Produce Keeper ids great for carrots, cucumbers, celery, kale, scallions and more. The GreenSaver Produce Keeper is BPA free and dishwasher safe. The 5 Qt Produce Keeper comes with one enhanced Carbon Filter. Each Filter lasts up to 90 days, at which point it will no longer have the capacity to absorb more ethylene. Filter refills are sold separately. To sign up for reminders to replace your filter, or to learn more about the OXO GreenSaver line, visit www.greensaver.oxo.com.\"\nList Price: $29.77\nCost: $12.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

It is also has an energy saving timer function (6 - 10 hours) and easy-to-hear sound indicator to alert completion of boiling process or low water level. Quick temp mode heats the water directly to the selected keep warm temperature without reaching a boil. The water will reach the selected keep warm temperature quicker than regular mode. Other benefits include reduced steam and reduced energy use. This mode should be used when DE chlorination is not necessary, such as when using bottled or purified water. To activate, press the reboil/quick temp button; the boil light blinks. The dechlorinate mode reduces chlorine and musty odors from tap water by extending the boiling time.\"\nList Price: $209.93\nCost: $86.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

This whole room heater has a thermostatic temperature control knob. Select your desired heat setting with a simple turn of the dial. This whole room heater features 3 heat settings to allow you to better tailor heat output and energy consumption to prevent circuit overloads. Vornado's signature Vortex heat circulation then distributes the warm air throughout the room. Unlike typical heaters whose hot coils create areas of extreme heat directly around the heater, the MVH outputs gentle heat that envelops the room in comfortable warmth. This household heater is whisper-quiet and employs advanced safety features to provide worry-free use. A tip-over switch automatically cuts the heat and power to the unit if tipped over. With Vornado's unique design, the MVH remains cool to the touch, even after hours of extended operation. And the MVH is backed by a 5-year promise for season after season of worry-free warmth.\nFrom the Manufacturer\nIMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL DISCLAIMER: This item is built to meet U.S. voltage requirements and may not function properly when used in conjunction with external devices that alter or convert voltage or frequency of electricity.

Included single wall filters provide a more challenging experience for those who have already mastered the art of espresso\nWhy the Breville BES840BSXL Infuser Espresso Machine?\nFor espresso with a well-balanced flavor, flavor needs to be drawn evenly from all the coffee grinds. What is the best way to prepare the grinds for an even extraction?\nRather than starting with bursts of high pressure, the Breville Infuser Espresso Machine in Black Sesame starts with steady, low pressure to gently expand the grinds. This helps fills in any cracks, gaps, or irregularities in the coffee puck before full pressure is applied, so even pressure is applied to all parts of the coffee puck and optimal flavor is extracted.\nBES840BSXL Features\nThe BES840BSXL has both automatic features, like temperature settings, and programmable features like volumetric control. The key features that set it apart from other espresso machines in its price range are the pre-infusion technology, the thermocoil heating system, and PID temperature control technology. See chart below for details.\nOther helpful features include a cup warmer on the top of the machine and a feature that removes excess water from the filter basket after coffee extraction, so the used grounds form a dry puck for quicker cleanup. The machine goes into 'Sleep Mode' after 1 hour and automatically shuts off after 3 hours. There is extra-tall cup clearance for brewing directly into travel mugs.\nOther touches include an ‘Empty Me!’ indicator that lets you know when the removable drip tray is full and a ‘Clean Me’ cleaning alert. The storage tray houses the included accessories. Lastly, all parts that come in contact with water and coffee are BPA free.\nClick on image to view larger\nProduct Features\nThe 61 fl. oz. (1.8 L) removable water tank is a top-fill tank with a handle. It has a replaceable water filter to reduce impurities and scale.\nThe 1600W thermocoil heating system circulates the water through a heated coil, heating water ‘on demand’ for better temperature consistency. It also uses PID technology to regulate the temperature.\nA 54mm stainless steel portafilter with commercial style spouts and a 54mm tamper are also included for expert tamping control. The tamper is stored magnetically on the machine, but is easily removable for tamping.\nThe dry puck feature removes excess water from the ground coffee in the filter basket for easy disposal of the coffee puck.\nThe espresso pressure gauge helps you monitor espresso extraction pressure, so you know whether the espresso is being over- or under-extracted.\nThe volumetric control functionlets you set shot volumes. Use either the preset volumes or manually over-ride them with your own preferences. Once you figure out what volumes you prefer, you can program it to remain at your customized setting.\nThe dedicated outlet for instant hot water (for making Americanos, hot chocolate, and for warming cups).\nThe steam wand is used for effortless milk frothing for making lattes and cappuccinos. It is made of stainless steel and swivels 360 degrees to accommodate different size frothing jugs.\nThe auto purge function automatically adjusts the temperature of the water used for steaming milk and extracting espresso. The function automatically begins to cool the boiler to the optimal temperature for espresso extraction after using the steam wand.\nThe removable drip tray is partitioned for both wet and dry spills, with an 'Empty me!' indicator for when it’s full.\"\nList Price: $799.99\nCost: $349.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

This cordless vacuum features an angled floorhead that’s designed for multiple surfaces, from hardwood to area rugs to carpets -- just use the 3-speed control to make your selection. The v-shaped bristle pattern tackles all types of messes, including pet hair, dust, and crumbs, and the patented anti-tangle brush bar minimizes hair wrap to maximize suction power. For added power, the twist-to-clean filter amps up the suction even more, while 55 minutes of runtime ensures long-lasting use. The stick vacuum also features LED lights on the floorhead, helping you to zero in on hidden dirt, and it evenconverts to a handheld vacuum with an extra-long crevice tool for those hard-to-reach spaces. Emptying debris is simple thanks to a front-facing dustbin, which also allows the vacuum to lay flat for cleaning tough-to-reach areas. And when you’re done, simply remove the 20V MAX* battery to charge it separately -- or leave it attached for simple charging while the vacuum stands on its own or hangs from its wall mount. *Maximum initial battery voltage (measured without a workload) is 20 volts. Nominal voltage is 18 volts. Dustbin Capacity .75 Liter.\"\nList Price: $199.99\nCost: $99.0\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Some people even used the spin cycle of their washing machine to dry lettuce. Our easy-to-use Spinner transformed the tool into an everyday kitchen essential. Nearly 20 years later, we revisited the Spinner to make some updates while keeping the top features and original inspiration: a children’s top. With a modern design that complements contemporary kitchens and an improved brake that stops on a dime every time, we think you’ll love our new spin on the classic design. Dry salad greens with a simple press of the soft, non-slip knob. The non-slip base keeps the bowl steady on the countertop, and the updated built-in brake button stops the Salad Spinner for unloading. The basket doubles as a colander, and the lid comes apart for easy cleaning.\"\nList Price: $30.99\nCost: $13.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

With its wide base, it can be the go-to for searing and browning meats. Or it can use its sloped, rounded sides to simmer stews or saucy entrees. It’s the ideal pan for preparing easy, one-pan meals during the week and making meals ahead during the weekend. As part of our D3 Collection, this Weeknight Pan features a bonded tri-ply construction made with a responsive aluminum core pressed together with 2 layers of durable, stainless steel all the way around the surface, for fast and even heat.  At 4 quarts, it’s big enough for those no-fuss one-pot meals and leaves you with enough for next day’s lunch. To keep your All-Clad looking brand new, we recommend washing your cookware with a soap and sponge instead of the dishwasher. Like all our bonded cookware, it's handmade in the USA at our Canonsburg, PA factory with ultra-durable materials that'll last a lifetime and never go out of style. A flat, stainless-steel lid is included to help lock in moisture. Handles & handle loops are made in China.\"\nList Price: $249.99\nCost: $125.83\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Made with a heavy duty adhesive layer and waterproof backing for extreme durability. This tape is UV and temperature resistant - great for projects and repairs both indoors and out. Crystal Clear Gorilla Duct Tape is best if used between 10°F and 120°F. To prevent fingerprints, clean your hands prior to using the tape and handle the tape only at edge. Use a straight edge (credit card or similar object), to press out fingerprints. For best results, apply the tape to a clean surface. Airtight patches are best achieved on smooth, dry surfaces with the tape on both sides of the repair (when accessible). Tape size should be larger than the repair area, extending beyond all edges. Rub the entire surface of the tape aggressively, especially the edges. NOTE: Surface patch will gain additional strength with time. Crystal Clear Gorilla Duct Tape works best for patching with a single layer. Not for patching inflatables at seams. Click on the Gorilla link at the top of this page to see other quality products from the Gorilla Glue Company.\"\nList Price: $16.37\nCost: $8.47\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Tim Reid and Tom Dreesen polished their act in the nightclubs of Chicago, then took it on the road, not only in the North, but in the still-simmering South as well, developing routines that even today remain surprisingly frank--and remarkably funny--about race.

By turns revealing, shocking, and riotously funny,\nRead more\"\nList Price: $35.0\nCost: $0.75\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

The music heard here represents the\nsound of an end and a beginning coming through at once. The set contains 5 separate performances of\nthe Miles Davis Quintet spread over 8 LPs and the energy and depth of feeling in the transcendent\nplaying hint at the special relationship Miles and the group had with the French nation that embraced\nthem in a way their homeland would not. It contains over 4 hours of revelatory, unreleased live music\nfeaturing Miles backed by George Coleman (on the 1963 recordings), Wayne Shorter (on the 1964\nrecordings), Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. This set expands on the 1964 live album\nMILES IN EUROPE which documented the Miles Davis Quintet’s performance at the Festival Mondial du\nJazz in Antibes in July 1963. While that album included a single edited set across 2LPs, this will include all\nthree very distinct performances from Antibes along with two never-before-released concerts from\nOctober 1964 in Paris, by which time Wayne Shorter had joined the band, so you could hear the Second\nGreat Quintet come together before your ears. The audio has been lovingly mixed and mastered in the\nhighest quality possible and the 8 LPs are packaged in 4 gatefold jackets housed in a luxe slipcase box\nwith a die-cut O-card and a 20 page book that includes dozens of unseen photos, ephemera and\nextensive liner notes by noted journalist Marcus J. Moore.\"\nList Price: $224.98\nCost: $151.97\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller. We are going to negotiate based on the Inventory List in 6 turns."

That’s why we developed the EcoTank ET-2800 – an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you’ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-2800 features genuine Epson print quality, a high-resolution flatbed scanner, and convenient color display – making it the ideal basic home printer.\nEpson strongly recommends the use of genuine ink to ensure optimal print quality and performance. Use of non-genuine ink could cause damage not covered under the printer’s ltd. wnty. | 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of March 2024. | 2. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of an included or replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of March 2024. | 3. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 125 pages. | 5. See www.epson.com/voice for device compatibility. Epson Connect™ account and voice-activated account registration required. | 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit www.epson.com/connect | 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel app download.

It helps with more signs of stress, in more situations, and calms cats better than ever; it may help reduce scratching, urine spraying (peeing), tensions & conflicts among cats, general fears, and reactions to changes. This new discovery, backed by FFELIWAY's 25+ years of feline stress expertise, delivers advanced calming messages, helping your cats feel more comfortable at home than ever before. When surveyed, 93% of cat owners reported enhanced calming for their cats when using FELIWAY Optimum. This product contains 6 refills for the FELIWAY Optimum diffuser (diffuser head not included). FELIWAY Optimum's heated diffuser and refill provide calming pheromones continually for up to 30 days in a 700 square foot area. We recommend using an additional diffuser if the room is bigger than 700 square feet. We recommend plugging in the FELIWAY Optimum diffuser in the room where you cat spends the most time, or where conflict among your cats happen most frequently. Try not to plug the diffuser under items (e.g. shelves) or close to objects (e.g. behind curtain or doors) as this affects efficacy. We do not recommend plugging your diffuser in near your litterbox or in a hallway - while your cat may frequent these places, they likely do not spend as much time in these places as you'd think. If your litterbox is in the room where your cat spends the most time, you will want to plug your diffuser into that room. Use FELIWAY Optimum each month to create a constant calming environment. Check the diffuser and refills monthly; you'll want to replace the refill each month, and replace the diffuser head twice a year (every six months) to guarantee the best effect. Make sure to only use a FELIWAY Optimum diffuser with a FELIWAY Optimum Refill. The diffuser is not compatible with refills from other brands, and the FELIWAY Optimum vial should not be used with other diffusers. Never use a diffuser or refill of another brand with a FELIWAY product. Each FELIWAY Diffuser comes with a plug adapted to the local electric systems. Please do not use this diffuser in another country that has a different voltage or with an adapter: it may conduct serious security concerns. Make sure that your diffuser has the fitting plug for your country before plugging in.\"\nList Price: $120.0\nCost: $67.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

The Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff is a smart home water security system that provides 24/7 protection by monitoring for water leaks—some as small as one drop of water per minute—and other vulnerabilities.\n\nDesigned by plumbing and tech industry professionals, Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff is installed on the main water supply line of the home. You can see live water use through the Moen Smart Water Network App, including water flow rates, pressure, and even temperature. If the Smart Water Shutoff detects an issue (e.g. high pressure, freezing water, or a small leak), a water sensor alarm will alert you through the app to assess the issue before it causes costly damage. If there is a catastrophic failure, like a burst pipe, you will be alerted in the app allowing you to shut the water off remotely—no matter where you are. If you fail to respond to the alert or are on vacation, the device can be set to automatically shut off water to help limit damage and loss.\n\nThe smart water app notifies you of abnormalities to remotely turn off the water from the Moen Smart Water Network App, or the device can be set to automatically close the valve to help prevent catastrophic damage. In addition to leaks, the device will notify you if it senses a fixture has been left on or if temperatures have dipped too low and pipes are at risk of freezing. The app is free, with no fees or subscriptions required. Should the Wi-Fi connection be lost, the device will still protect the home as it stores the latest learnings locally, allowing it to continue safeguarding the home until a Wi-Fi connection has been restored.\n\nEverything needed for installation is included in the box. Professional installation is recommended and takes just a few hours when the home meets installation requirements.\n\nThe colors of the physical product may vary.\"\nList Price: $767.7\nCost: $297.0\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller. We are going to negotiate based on the Inventory List in 6 turns."

The powerful 4V Screwdriver from Worx provides 300 rpm of no-load speed for a max hard torque of 44 in-lbs, and a max soft torque of 22 in-lbs. Yet, this tool is only 1.5 lbs itself, feels great in the hands, and is easy to hold from multiple angles and in varied positions to get at tough to reach fasteners. Getting a manual screwdriver into a tight space isn’t usually the problem, but generating enough torque once you get it in there usually is. With this Worx automatic screwdriver, all you have to do to generate max torque is hold down a button. The 4V motor is as powerful as some drills, and you’ll get about 45 minutes of no-load working time on a single charge. But because you’re likely to use this tool in short bursts, it will effectively last much longer than 45 minutes. Plus, it charges back up in only an hour and a half. This model comes with a box full of bits. That’s the other advantage of auto screwdrivers: you just need one and a few bits, instead of a dozen separate tools. This tool is covered by a 3-year limited warranty because we’re confident in the longterm performance of our tools. Take a step to improving the longterm performance of your hands with the 4V Screwdriver from Worx. You’ll notice the benefits immediately and still feel them well down the road.\"\nList Price: $49.99\nCost: $19.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

DEWALT fixed router features precise depth adjustments and fast, easy motor pack removal for bit and base changes. The plunge base integral dust collection provides superior bit visibility.\nAmazon.com\nFeaturing a 12 amp variable-speed, soft-start motor, the DEWALT 2-1/4-Inch Fixed-Base/Plunge-Base Router Combo Kit is packed with smart design features that make routing easy. Depth adjustment and base changes are tool free, and integrated dust control keeps work spaces clean and improves cut line visibility.\nPowerful and Accurate with Variable-Speed Control\nThe 2-1/4-horsepower, 12 amp motor allows the router to cut through the toughest hardwoods. The router's electronic variable-speed trigger lets you select from between 8,000 and 24,000 rpm for specific applications. And because this system employs full electronic feedback, you can trust the router to provide constant speed under load. In addition, the motor's soft start reduces start-up torque for optimum control.\nThe router's fixed base features a micro-fine depth-adjustment ring that provides precise bit adjustments in 1/64-inch increments. Because the ring--not the motor can--turns to adjust bit depth, a constant switch/cordset location is maintained when you are using the router in a table. This minimizes difficulty in turning the unit on and off and keeps operation consistent.\nThe plunge base features an adjustable five-position turret stop for use when making repeated plunge cuts. The easy-to-reach plunge-release lever and switch keep control at your fingertips during routing.\nQuick, Secure Base and Bit Changes\nThe clear, LEXAN sub-base offers optimum bit visibility and base durability, and it accepts standard template-guide bushings to make application-specific setups easy. Also, a sub-base concentricity gauge is included. If you insert this into the collet prior to bit installation, it will help you center the sub-base relative to bit location when making your cut line off of the side of the base.\nMoreover, the sub-base and other included bases are designed to make both base and bit changes easy. Quick-release motor latches allow for fast and easy motor-pack removal, while a spindle-lock button allows for single-wrench bit changes. The fixed base also offers a flat top, so the router can be set upside down for easy bit and depth changes. Additionally, long, self-releasing, eight-slotted collets provide improved bit retention and prevent bits from jamming.\nBuilt for Consistency and Durability\nRouting applications produce a lot of dust, which can result in extra wear and tear on electronic parts. That's why this system features a dust-sealed switch that protects against dust ingestion for longer tool life. Other components that contribute to the tool's overall consistency and durability include heavy-duty metal housings, precision-machined brass bushings, and case-hardened steel guide rods on the plunge base.\nComfortable Operation with Integrated Dust Control\nEach base features comfortable rubber over-molded handles and a low center of gravity for improved balance and control and reduced user fatigue. The base also has a patented through-the-column dust-collection system. This allows a vacuum to be attached to the router without blocking your line of sight.\nIn addition, this router kit offers you the ability to work with the switch and cordset on either your left or right side. Also contributing to this setup's usability is a detachable cordset that can be easily serviced. A shorty cord motor pack is not required if you opt to place the motor can in a D-Handle base.\nThe DW618PK DEWALT 2-1/4-Inch EVS Fixed Base/ Plunge Base Router Combo Kit with Soft Start is backed by a three-year limited warranty.\nWhat's in the Box\nDW618M motor pack, DW6184 fixed base, DW6182 plunge base, 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch collets, wrench, sub-base concentricity gauge, large-hole sub-base, vacuum adapter, and kit box.\n\n\nSee more\"\nList Price: $249.99\nCost: $146.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller. We are going to negotiate based on the Inventory List in 6 turns."

Not only was the ZipSnip Cutting Tool designed to do all the jobs that scissors can’t, but it also makes everyday cutting jobs that much easier. Its self-sharpening blade slices right through cardboard, so it’s an excellent tool for taking out the recyclables. It even glides through rubber and leather, so it’s an indispensable implement for crafting and/or DIY projects. It’s precise, much more so than scissors, and has a lot more power behind it than a utility knife. It’s perfect for opening heavy bags like pet food, seed, or fertilizer without spilling because you don’t need a lot of motion to use it, like with knives and scissors. It has a soft grip, so it’s comfortable to use, and the compact design only weighs 1 pound. The lockout switch prevents accidental starts. And it’ll hold a charge for months, so you can keep it in a kitchen drawer and it’ll be ready to go whenever you need it. A charger is included, so you can refill the 4v battery whenever the on-board charge light lets you know it’s time. And it’s great for outdoor use— keep one in the garage or shed and use it for detailed landscaping. The rake was a handy tool until the leaf blower came along. And scissors were nice before the invention of the ZipSnip. Give your hands a break, get a ZipSnip. Status indicator lets you know when the battery is fully charged.\"\nList Price: $52.54\nCost: $21.15\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Speaking of bases, this kit comes with a whole bunch of accessories: (1) 20V Power Share Max 2.0Ah battery; (1) 5-hour charger; (5) sanding bases: Random Orbit, ¼” finishing, detail, finger, and contour; (3) sanding sheets for each pad (15 sheets in total), 60, 80, and 120 grits; dust collection bag with adapter; hole punch for finishing pad. The 5” random orbit function is your hardworking\n\norbital sanders and does all the tougher sanding when you’re starting a project. The ¼” sheet finishing function smooths it down. The detail function with cordless detail sander lets you get into tight corners. The finger sander attachment lets you really get into the smaller spaces. And the detail contour is for rounded, bowl-like shapes. And with all that power and utility, you might expect this tool to leave a mess behind. Not so, as a matter of fact, the micro-dust filter cleans the air as you work, so you’ll breathe easier and have less to clean up afterward. The SANDECK is part of the WORX Power Share platform of power and lawn & garden tools. That means you can share the 20V battery that comes with this model with any other tool in the family.

This will result in a cutting angle of 30°– 40°. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.\n\nCLEANING\nIf the blades of knife begin to stick together, open and close the blades in warm water several times - this will allow the tools to move easily again. Once dry, apply a drop of Swiss Army Knife Oil between each tool and its spring. Do not put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher.\n\nHISTORY & HERITAGE\nIn 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and his cutlers’ union produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professionals and home cooks. Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier’s Knife and Officer’s Knife. After the death of his mother, and with the advent of stainless steel, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born. Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.\"\nList Price: $60.61\nCost: $21.79\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Competitive forstner bit designs produce small chips and dust that collect in the cutting area, increasing friction and heat, thus causing the bit to dull quickly. Those designs also create holes with rough edges that require sanding. In addition to serrated edges, Precision Shear Forstner Bits include a hardened steel body for longer life and sharper edge, an ultra sharp spur to ensure accurate holes and less \"walking\", and steep angled cutting edges to produce holes that are smooth and flat.

In doing so, the booster pump optimizes every aspect of the reverse osmosis process from production speed to drain ratio.\nOur products are tested annually to remove up to 99.99% of harmful contaminants that commonly appear in municipal and well water. All filters, tanks, tubing and other water-contacting parts are manufactured to comply strictly with NSF/ANSI standard (58 for reverse osmosis).\nThe RCC7P-AK has earned an international mark of product quality from one of the most recognized and trusted drinking water treatment programs in the world. All of our systems go through rigorous testing for air leaks, pressure and cycle resistance to maintain our own premium quality and high performance standards.\n\nThe electric booster pump ensures reliable, consistent performance regardless of pressure variations. This allows the system to achieve up to 50% faster tank fill rates with up to 50% less water waste.\nArsenic & Barium & Cadmium\nArsenic & Barium & Cadmium\nCopper & Lead & Iron & Manganese\nFluoride\nRadium (226/228)\nAnd more...\nPrecision Performance\nThe RCC7P-AK is a pressure-boosted, multi-layered filter system that provides optimal protection against over 1,000 different types of contaminants, including arsenic, asbestos, chlorine, fluoride, lead, mercury, sodium, and more. Boosting the water pressure improves the performance of the Reverse Osmosis filter stage increasing water production speed and reducing waste water. This is essential when the home water pressure is low (below 40 PSI).\n3 Pre-filters: PP sediment filter. Carbon KDF (GAC) filter. Carbon block (CTO) filter. They remove large contaminants and protect the RO membrane from chemicals like chlorine and chloramines.\nThe heart of the system is the Reverse Osmosis (RO) filter that removes contaminants down to 0.0001 microns – so small that only water molecules can squeeze through but virtually nothing else.\nFine GAC filter provides final polishing before the purified water is delivered to the faucet.\nAn Alkaline Remineralization filter restores healthy minerals and a natural alkaline balance, while also producing a more natural taste.\nThe end result is great-tasting bottled-water quality.\nReinforced Transparent 1st Stage Housing\nProvides an easy way to visually inspect the sediment filter and view the contaminants being removed from your water. With the transparent housing you will know it is time for a filter change before a problem occurs.\nFinest Micron, Layered Protection\nThe advantage of having both 5-micron GAC & CTO filters is that loose carbon (GAC, KDF) is better at trapping large contaminants, leaving only smaller ones to the CTO carbon block filter. This allows the CTO filter and RO membrane to function at their maximum efficiency and last longer.\nLeak-Free System & Online Supporting Videos\nPush to connect fittings and color coordinated tubings simplify the installation process. We know that high percentage of our customers prefer Do-it-yourself installation. We are investing in video production to provide our customers the resources needed to have successful installation and maintenance.\nAny Question?\nContact our support team for assistance in selecting the right system for your water filtration needs.

MERV 8 furnace filters are comparable to HVAC filters with the rating of MPR 800. Nordic Pure furnace air filters are manufactured using a heavy duty, moisture resistant beverage board frame. As with all Nordic Pure furnace air filters, the material is electrostatically charged to attract unwanted particles. The media used will not promote the growth of bacteria or mold on the air filter. For fresh, clean air in your home and office, it is important to regularly change your AC filter, especially during home improvements. We recommend changing your HVAC furnace filter every 1-3 months, depending on your unique home or office environment. People with pets or those who suffer from allergies should change their A/C air filters more often. Replacing your air filter regularly not only improves indoor air quality, it helps your HVAC unit perform more efficiently. Important Note: Almost all air condition filters have a different Actual Size than Nominal Size printed on the air conditioning filter. It is best to measure the exact size of your A/C filter and compare it to our Actual Size to be sure your HVAC replacement filter fits!\nFrom the Manufacturer\nThe Nordic Pure MERV 8 anti-allergen pleated air filters are made out of an electrostatically charged synthetic material that draws airborne particulates to it like a magnet. Electrostatic filters help trap airborne particles to protect your family from pollen, household dust, mold spores, and dust mites. With each pass through the pleated filtered, the air in your living environment improves. Nordic Pure's synthetic filter media will not permit the growth of bacteria or mold, therefore, making your environment healthier. This air filter will capture other large particle contaminants to keep surfaces free of dust longer in your home. MERV 8 air filters are comparable to air filters with the MPR rating of 500-600 or FPR rating of Green. Particles in indoor air are measured in microns, which are 1/1000 of a millimeter. A human hair is about 70 microns wide. A MERV 8 Nordic Pure air filter captures airborne particles as small as 3.0 to 10.0 microns. This high performance air filter will outperform non-electrostatic fiber-glass filters, washable filters, and poly disposable filters. The MERV 8 electrostatic pleated air filter will help keep your air conditioning and heating systems running efficiently, saving on utilities and maintenance costs. The effectiveness of your air filter will depend on your environment. We recommend that you change the air filter every 30-90 days depending on the conditions in your home.\"\nList Price: $57.77\nCost: $27.36\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

The type of your Action must be one of \"[SELL],[REJECT],[DEAL],[QUIT]\".\n1. '[SELL] $M (N codename_1)' if you want to propose selling N items of the product with the codename \"codename_1\" to the buyer for the total price of $M.\n2. '[REJECT]' if you choose to reject the other side's offer and await a new offer from the buyer.\n3. '[DEAL] $M (N codename_1)' if you finally agree on a former offer proposed by the buyer, and sell N items of the product with the codename \"codename_1\" to the buyer for the total price of $M. $M (N codename_1) is a exact copy of buyer's previous offer. You should not use this action to propose a new price. This action will immediately end the conversation and close the deal.\n4. '[QUIT]' if you believe that a mutually acceptable deal cannot be reached in limited turns. This action will immediately end the conversation.\nYou shouldn't choose action '[DEAL]' before buyer's action '[BUY]'.\n'[DEAL] $M (N codename_1)' can only be chosen to accept the buyer's previous offer '[BUY] $M (N codename_1)'. Otherwise, you always choose from '[SELL]', '[REJECT]' and '[QUIT]'.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow this format, for example:\nThought: I'm a seller, so I must sell the product with codename \"apple_1\" higher than its cost.\nTalk: blah, blah...\nAction: [SELL] $15 (1x apple_1)\n"
