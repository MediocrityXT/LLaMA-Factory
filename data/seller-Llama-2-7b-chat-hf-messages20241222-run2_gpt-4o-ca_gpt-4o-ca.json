Icons\"\nDescription: \"From the Publisher\nBringing together all the greats—from Air Jordan 1 to Air Presto—Nike and Virgil Abloh reinvent sneaker culture with the collaborative project The Ten and redesign 10 sneaker icons. Experience engineering ingenuity and Abloh’s investigative design process: each shoe is a piece of industrial design, a readymade sculpture, and a wearable all at once.\nVirgil Abloh (1980–2021) was a multi-hyphenate creative that often rejected classification on creativity. He operated in the realms of Art, Design, and Culture in conjunction with advocacy, mentoring, and philanthropy in the spaces he occupied. After earning a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he completed a master’s degree in Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago. At IIT, while studying a Bauhaus design curriculum devised by Mies van der Rohe, Abloh began to craft the principles of his broader art practice. The Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago presented a major traveling survey of Abloh’s work in summer 2019—one of the highest attended exhibitions in the museum’s history. Abloh was the Chief Creative Director and founder of Off-White and from 2018 to 2021 Men’s Artistic Director at Louis Vuitton, amongst other endeavors.\nThe Sneaker as (Hyper)Object\nIn 2016, sportswear manufacturer Nike and fashion designer Virgil Abloh joined forces to create a sneaker collection celebrating 10 of the Oregon-based company’s most iconic shoes. With their project The Ten—which reimagines icons like Air Jordan 1, Air Max 90, Air Force 1, and Air Presto, among others—they reinvigorated sneaker culture.\nVirgil Abloh’s new designs offer deep insights into engineering ingenuity and burst with cultural cachet. Drawing on the genius of the original shoe using lettering, ironic labels, collage, and sculpting techniques, Abloh plays with language and sculptural elements to construct new meaning. Inspired by the wit of Dadaism, architectural theory, and avant-garde happenings, he analyzes what makes each shoe iconic and deconstructs it into an artistic assemblage, making each shoe into a piece of industrial design, a readymade sculpture, and a wearable all at once.\nCopyright: Virgil Abloh/Nike\nIcons traces Abloh’s investigative, creative process through documentation of the prototypes, original text messages from Abloh to Nike designers, and treasures from the Nike archives.\nCopyright: Virgil Abloh/Nike\nWe find Swooshes sliced away from Air Jordans and reapplied with tape or thread, Abloh’s typical text fragments in quotation marks on Air Force 1, and All Stars cut into pieces.\nCopyright: Virgil Abloh/Nike\nWe take a look behind the scenes and witness Abloh’s DIY approach, which gives each model in the collection its own unique touch.\nThe book documents Abloh’s cooperative way of working and reaffirms the power of print. For its design Nike and Abloh partnered with the acclaimed London-based design studio Zak Group. Together they conceived a two-part compendium, equal parts catalog and conceptual toolbox. The first part of the book presents a visual culture of sneakers while a lexicon in the second part defines the key people, places, objects, ideas, materials, and scenes from which the project grew. Texts by Nike’s Nicholas Schonberger, writer Troy Patterson, curator and historian Glenn Adamson, and Virgil Abloh himself frame the collaborative work within fashion and design history. A foreword by Hiroshi Fujiwara places the project within the historical continuum of Nike collaborators.\"\nList Price: $80.0\nCost: $44.47\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

When I use an 11mm Plossl eyepiece (almost 200x magnification) for example, I can easily see the Cassini Division in Saturn's rings. When I look at Jupiter, the pale orange color of Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot is visible, and I've even been able to identify the polar caps and spot dust storms on the planet Mars. A 20mm Plossl eyepiece (about 100x magnification) is a good choice for viewing galaxies and star clusters. When I look at globular cluster M13 in the constellation Hercules the high contrast XLT optics show me a glowing snowflake made of hundreds of tiny pin-point stars! And a low power 32mm Plossl eyepiece is a good choice for views of larger deep space highlights like the Andromeda Galaxy and the Orion Nebula.\nCelestron's patented \"SkyAlign\" system makes the Nexstar 8 SE very easy to use. I just pick the nearest town from the built-in list, enter the date and time, and point the telescope at three bright stars. I don't need a star chart because \"SkyAlign\" identifies the stars for me. When I just want a quick look at the moon or a planet, I like to use the \"Solar System Align\" option. After entering the date and time, I just point the telescope at the moon and press the \"Align\" key. That's all it takes, the computer takes over and the telescope begins tracking quietly and accurately. At star parties I often have my Nexstar up and running while older computerized telescopes are still waiting for their alignment stars to appear in the twilight.\nThe Nexstar 8 SE comes with a simple red-dot finder scope and a basic 25mm eyepiece. You'll want to add a few good eyepieces to take full advantage of the Nexstar 8 SE's excellent optics. At the very least get Celestron's bargain priced Accessory Kit which includes high and low power plossl eyepieces, or treat yourself to some top rated Tele Vue eyepieces. At twenty-four pounds total weight, the Nexstar 8 SE is unusually light and portable for an eight-inch telescope. The drawback of course is that some people will find it too light. Like other Schmidt Cassegrain (SCT) telescopes there are plenty of optional accessories to upgrade this telescope with, such as heavy duty tripods and an optical finder scope. If you want to try astro-photography, however, check out Celestron's CPC 800 Telescope which features a heavy duty mount and tripod and an 8x50 optical finder scope right out of the box. --Jeff Phillips\nPros:\nExcellent optics\nEasy computerized GoTo tracking\nLight, portable and affordable\nCons:\nPlastic accessories\nShort battery life\nToo light for astro-photography\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\"\nList Price: $1599.0\nCost: $799.0\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

This majestic Downswept Douglas Fir tree is 7.5 feet tall and 59 inches in diameter at the bottom, giving the tree a wide profile. Friends and family alike will marvel at how the tree closely mimics those outside. Molded from real tree branches for an authentic living tree appearance, this tree features our trademarked ‘Feel Real’ technology. Hundreds of crush-resistant polyethylene tips form full bodied branches, creating a tree with remarkable realism. The tree is designed with a hinged branch system that allows the branches to swing down for a quick and simple set-up and fold back in for easy storage. Set aside 45-60 minutes after assembly to properly shape the tree by peeling back the branches and pulling the tips apart to give the branches a more full-bodied look. Once the tree is fluffed to your liking, weave your desired lights through the branches starting from the top and moving down towards the bottom. Before dressing the tree in twinkling lights and glistening ornaments, consider placing it in a living room or dining area where it can be viewed from multiple angles and does not block any entryways. Constructed with sturdy, high quality materials and hypo-allergenic, fire-resistant needles, this tree is built to bring holiday cheer for years to come. At National Tree Company, we strive to create high quality Christmas decorations to help you transform your home so you can keep making every holiday moment magical.\"\nList Price: $549.99\nCost: $174.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Many of these films are debuting for the first time on Blu-ray. Get ready for some exciting thrills and chills as heroes meet villains in a duel to the death! The Assassin In the same year that director/writer Chang Cheh and star Jimmy Wang Yu revolutionized Hong Kong kung fu cinema with One-Armed Swordsman, they also collaborated on this epic of the Six Kingdoms era. Here, Yu is a two-armed swordsman who is also a Wei Empire patriot. Inside the Han Empire, Han Kuei, who comes from the royal family, assumes full power and wants to eliminate loyal officer Yen Sui. Later, our main character is betrayed by a jealous rival and becomes a village butcher. But when he meets Yen Sui, he is sent back on the road of vengeance. Chiao Chiao, the lovely and talented costar of One-Armed Swordsman, here plays Hsia, the love of the hero's life and the strong woman who survives to protect their child. The Thundering Sword Superstar swordswoman Cheng Pei-pei, (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), stars as the daughter of the Poison Master in a Romeo and Juliet-style martial arts adventure concerning a search for the magical \"Heaven and Earth\" weapon in The Thundering Sword. The Golden Swallow The indomitable martial arts team of director Chang Cheh and stunt choreographer Liu Chia-liang continues the compelling saga of The Golden Swallow from King Hu's Come Drink with Me in this sequel of heartbreaking romance, intrigue and stunning action. The Jade Raksha Thanks in great part to Cheng Pei-pei, women in martial arts movies played a more central role in the plots and the swordswomen of the genre became some of the most charismatic figures in Hong Kong cinema. In The Jade Raksha, Cheng Pei-pei becomes a human combine harvester as she hacks and whacks a path through life, avenging the death of her family under the moniker \"The Jade Raksha.\" The Bells of Death The Bells of Death is a whirlwind story about a man embarking on a life-long journey to master the sword, then find and eliminate the three men who killed his family and abducted his sister. The Sword of Swords Jimmy Wang Yu had just exploded into superstardom as One-Armed Swordsman when he teamed with respected writer/director Cheng Kang for this tale of master martial artists vying for the title blad—a \"weapon of exceptional brilliance.\" And with legendary martial arts choreographers Lau Kar-leung and Tang Chia directing the action, the result is a superb, flat-out adventure of intrigue, deception, and an abduction, delivering one battle after another until it culminates in an amazing all-out slaughter. Killer Dart Rampaging bandits are pillaging peaceful Chinese villages until the grieving dart master Liu Wen Lung sets out with his student, son, and servant to avenge his murdered wife and set things right. Renowned director Ho Meng-Hua—soon to be internationally famous for The Flying Guillotine—masterfully balances action with intrigue and romance, as the path of righteousness is littered with lies…and corpses. The Invincible Fist The Invincible Fist is one of the few films where the godfather of the kung fu film Chang Cheh headlined Lo Lieh as the leading hero three years before Lo would become the Shaw Brothers' first international star in King Boxer (aka Five Fingers of Death). Here he plays a dedicated chief constable for Tsang Chou village who falls in love with the blind daughter of a bandit who is wreaking havoc. Joining him in all the action and emotion are award-winning actor Ku Feng and future superstar David Chiang. Dragon Swamp Cheng Pei-pei, the screen's greatest swordswoman, teams with Lo Lieh for this amazing, fast-paced adventure of the \"Martial Arts World\"—where everyone is killing to gain the famous \"Jade Dragon Sword.\" Fascinating characters, like the Roaming Knight and the Master of Dragon Swamp, clash in this family feud, which takes place over twenty years. In addition to the spectacular fights, this special production holds an emotional wallop for the finale. The Flying Dagger Godfather of the kung fu film, director Chang Cheh is famous for introducing the revolutionary concept of \"yanggang\" (macho) martial arts movies. Until then, female stars (often in male swordsman roles) ruled the screens. This collaboration between him and swordswoman supreme Cheng Pei-pei is exceptional indeed. Cheng could hold her own with any man, freeing Chang to create the best of all possible martial arts worlds. The Golden Sword Lo Wei remains internationally famous for directing Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan's first major movies. Cheng Pei-pei is now internationally famous for her superlative villainous role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But both were superstars in Hong Kong for decades prior, so any teaming of the superlative \"swordswoman supreme\" and the vaunted director/writer/actor is cause for celebration. Kao Yuen joins them as a noble swordsman, and award-winning actor Ku Feng stars as the Frontier Terror in the evocative and effective \"Martial Arts World\" adventure.\n\nBonus Content:\nDisc 1 - The Assassin (1967):\nAudio Commentary by David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 2 - The Thundering Sword:\nFrom a Western Perspective: An Interview About the Transnational Appeal of The Shaw Brothers with Academic Leon Hunt, Author of \"Kung Fu Cult Masters: From Bruce Lee To Crouching Tiger\"\nInterview with Author and Critic Kim Newman About The Western \"Breakthrough\" Films of Sir Run Run Shaw, Which Took the Producer From East To West\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 3 - The Golden Swallow:\nAudio Commentary by Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nInterview with Actress Cheng Pei-Pei by Frédéric Ambroisine\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 4 - The Jade Raksha:\nSlicing at the Stars: An Interview with Critic and Hong Kong Film Expert Tony Rayns, About The Emergence, Key Players, and Success of The Shaw Brothers Wuxia Film\nA Very Vocal Violence: Hong Kong Based Dubber Peter Boczar Reflects on His Time Behind the Microphone for a Number Of Martial Arts Masterpieces.\nDisc 5 - The Bells of Death:\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 6 - The Sword of Swords:\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 7 - Killer Darts:\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, veteran Hong Kong film critic at easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 8 - The Invincible Fist:\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, veteran Hong Kong film critic at easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 9 - Dragon Swamp:\nAudio Commentary with Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 10 - The Flying Dagger:\nAudio Commentary with Frank Djeng of the New York Asian Film Festival\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 11 - The Golden Sword:\nAudio Commentary with Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nCelestial Trailer\n]]>\"\nList Price: $169.98\nCost: $85.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Many of these films are debuting for the first time on Blu-ray. Get ready for some exciting thrills and chills as heroes meet villains in a duel to the death! Lady of Steel: Cheng Pei-pei was Hong Kong's first and most celebrated queen of kung fu because her performances set all the standards for future female martial arts stars like Michelle Yeoh. Lady Of Steel is a high-plains-drifter adventure where Cheng Pei-pei plays a swordswoman on a mission: to find the bandits that killed her parents and save the country from foreign invaders. Brothers Five: Years before he was to become famous for directing Bruce Lee in Fist of Fury and Jackie Chan in New Fist of Fury, Lo Wei teamed with superstar swordswoman Cheng Pei-pei (Come Drink with Me) for this action thriller of brotherly love…and death. She stars as Yen Lai, the one woman who can reunite the Kao brothers to rid the Teng Lung Manor of killers—as well as take revenge for their father's murder. The Crimson Charm: Huang Feng both writes and directs this \"Martial Arts World\" thriller of a noble swordsman and a one-armed swordswoman up against the vicious Crimson Charm gang of thieves and cutthroats. The lovely and lethal Ivy Ling Po teams with the amazing Chang I for a classic tale of good versus evil in which the best man—and one-armed woman—wins. The Shadow Whip: This top-ten box office hit reunites the star duo from Come Drink with Me in another classic action adventure. Cheng Pei-pei (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) radiates her trademark charm while wielding the deadly title weapon, which is implicated in multiple murders and a major heist. Whether single-handedly fighting sixteen bandits or avenging her father's brutal death, she demonstrates why she was Hong Kong's number one swordswoman—and no slouch with the whip either! The Delightful Forest Co-directed by Chang Cheh and Pao Hsueh-li, and written by Ni Kuang, Chang Cheh and Chin Shu-Mei, The Delightful Forest revolves around the legendary hero Wu Sung (Ti Lung), who was sent to the prison in the Meng province after murdering his sister-in-law and a local ruffian. There he was acquainted with the prison officer \"Golden Eye\" Shih En (Tien Ching), who saved Wu from the baton punishment required for new prisoners. Wu found out that Shih's restaurant, \"Delightful Forest,\" was taken by the local thug \"Door God\" Chiang Chung (Chu Mu). The Devil's Mirror: This is Sun Chung's very first film for the Shaw Brothers, making it especially interesting and important. He hit the ground running with this action-filled tale of a \"Devil Girl\" who is setting one clan against another to get her hands on two amazing mirrors with supernatural powers. Only a noble swordsman (played by Lau Dan) and beautiful swordswoman (played by The Thundering Sword star Shu Pei-pei) can stop her. Man of Iron: Chen Kuan-tai exuded incredible power on screen, which his directors used to great advantage in this fight-filled follow-up to the smash hit The Boxer from Shantung. The only thing Chou Lien Huan does wrong is win some money gambling with a Shanghai gang leader's playboy son…but that's enough for the father and child to want obsessive revenge. It all culminates in an incredible climatic fight, choreographed by the legendary Lau Kar-leung and Chan Chuen, co-star of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury. The Water Margin: The Chang Cheh-directed The Water Margin is the martial arts epic of epics…of epics. Based on the true legend of how 108 rebel heroes living in the mountains were able to repeatedly defeat invading Sung armies, the film starred just about anyone who was a name at Shaw Brothers at the time, like David Chiang, Chen Kuan-tai and Ti Lung. The primitive battles ultimately end in sharp, visually effective images of death and defeat. This is a must-see for any movie fan. The Bride from Hell: Never marry a possessed woman…especially one possessed by the spirit of a girl murdered by the uncle of the groom! That is the moral of this fascinating production, released a full two years before the international success of The Exorcist. Justice must be done and an exorcism, Hong Kong-style, must be performed before anyone can rest in peace. Talented Margaret Hsing Hui makes a fetching spirit in this mystery thriller that also incorporates a laugh or two amidst the chills. Heroes Two: Of the dozens of great martial arts movies made by this prolific and respected director, this tale of legendary Shaolin avengers Fang Shih-yu and Hung Hsi-kuan is often considered one of his best. His collaboration with equally renowned kung fu choreographer Lar Kar-leung was apparent in all the performances, but especially with that of charismatic, capable, then 19-year-old Alexander Fu Sheng. This powerful production is a true landmark in kung fu film history. The Flying Guillotine: Director Ho Meng-hua attained cult status among Western kung fu film fans with The Flying Guillotine. One of the Shaw Brothers' biggest martial arts stars, Chen Kuan-tai, plays the leader of a group of killers, commissioned by the Ching Emperor to use a deadly, beheading weapon to assassinate dissidents. Although based on a true story, the film's weapon was a complete fabrication because in real life, no one ever survived to tell what the actual weapon really looked like. The Dragon Missle: The many fans of the internationally popular Flying Guillotine films and international star Lo Lieh (King Boxer) will love this movie, featuring some of the most exciting martial arts machinery ever conceived. Everybody's fighting for a special elixir and the title tool—an ultra—cool flying boomerang with blades. There are double crosses and ambushes galore before the culminating clash of sizzling steel that must be seen to be believed.\n\nBonus Content:\nDisc 1 - Lady of Steel:\nAudio Commentary by Cult Film Critic Ian Jane\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 2 - Brothers Five:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nAudio Commentary by Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 3 - The Crimson Charm:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 4 - The Shadow Whip:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 5 - Delightful Forest:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary with Cult Film Critic Ian Jane\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 6 - The Devil's Mirror:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 7 - Man of Iron:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKicks\nAudio Commentary with Chris Poggiali, Co-Author of This Fists Break Bricks and Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAn Iron Will—Meredith Lewis, Author of Ask for the Moon: Innovation at Shaw Brothers Studios, A 77-Minute Documentary on The Genesis, Rise, Peak and Fall of the Shaw Brothers Movie Empire\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nGerman Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 8 - The Water Margin:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema blog)\nThe Master: Chang Cheh\nElegant Trails: Ti Lung\nElegant Trails: David Chiang\nExtended Love Scene\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nTV S pot for the U.S. release Seven Blows of the Dragon\nDisc 9 - The Bride from Hell:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKicks\nA More Traditional Terror: Hong Kong Film Historian Tony Rayns Talks Shaw Brothers Horror Films\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 10 - Heroes Two:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary by David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nGerman Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 11 - The Flying Guillotine:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKicks\nAudio Commentary with Chris Poggiali, Co-Author of These Fists Break Bricks and Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nFlying Without Wings: Actor Kai Kang Shares His Memories of Working with the Studio in His First Ever On-Camera Interview\nDubbing Delirium: Joseph Ellison, Dubbing Artist on Flying Guillotine for Its U.S. Release, Reflects on the Early Kung-Fu Film Boom\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 12 - The Dragon Missle:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKic ks\nCutting Comments: Jim Marcovic, Editor of Many Martial Arts Trailers for U.S. Cinemas During The 70s and 80s, Speaks About the Kung Fu Film Boom\nTrailers For Shaw Brothers Classics Volume 1 and the Brave Archer Collection (The Jade Raksha, Little Dragon Maiden, Killer Darts, The Flying Dagger, Dragon Swamp, The Brave Archer and His Mate, The Bells of Death, The Sword of Swords, The Invincible Fist\n]]>\"\nList Price: $187.99\nCost: $90.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

The Beatles: George Harrison (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, sitar, tamboura, harmonica, tambourine, comb & paper); John Lennon (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, piano, Hammond organ, maracas, comb & paper); Paul McCartney (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, piano, harpsichord, Hammond organ, bass, comb & paper); Ringo Starr (vocals, harmonica, piano, drums, bongos). Additional personnel includes: Neil Aspinall (tamboura, harmonica); Mal Evans (harmonica, alarm clock); George Martin (piano, harmonium, Wurlitzer organ, organ); Sounds Incorporated (saxophone, French horn, trombone). Engineers include: Geoff Emerick, Malcolm Addey, Ken Townsend. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios and Regent Sound Studio, London, England between December 6, 1966 and April 21, 1967. Includes liner notes by George Martin, Mark Lewisohn and Peter Blake. One of the most famous and influential albums ever recorded, SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND had a huge impact on the music world, signaling the beginning of a new era of sophistication and maturity in rock. The musical experimentation was dynamic and fresh, several tracks were edited to create seamless transitions, and even the visual design was more elaborate than anything previously attempted. Producer George Martin and The Beatles searched for new sounds and studio effects. They added crowd sounds and animal cries from sound-effects recordings, sped up Paul McCartney's vocals in \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" (to make him sound younger), and sustained a single piano chord for 40 seconds to end \"A Day In The Life.\" The orchestrations, scored by Martin, were hailed by critics as bridging the gap between pop and classical music, and many people who had never bought a rock record bought SGT.

Unfortunately, even that begins to look like a futile endeavor after a sandstorm ravages their close-knit community. Meanwhile, a seemingly supernatural mystery begins to unfold when the \"ghost\" that dwells in Murph's room sends her a mysterious set of coordinates - which lead the curious father/daughter duo to a clandestine underground base housing the remnants of NASA. There, renowned physicist Professor Brand (Michael Caine) has been working with a team of astronauts and scientists to find a new planet capable of sustaining human life. Brand quickly persuades Cooper to pilot a mission that will hopefully carry the seeds of human life to a habitable planet in another galaxy.

More than 3 feet tall and 4 feet wide, the Barbie Dreamhouse has so many amazing features -- three stories, eight rooms that include a carport (car not included) and a home office, a working elevator that fits four dolls or a Barbie doll in a wheelchair, a pool that has a slide descending from the story above, five pieces of transforming furniture, lights, sounds and more than 60 additional accessories, including an adorable puppy, that can all be used to decorate, set the scene and play out so many stories. Plug-and-play design helps keep pieces in place as small hands move around (and make clean up easy for adult hands!). Decorations and furniture for indoor and outdoor settings inspire play from all angles, and the transformations provide two-in-one fun while encouraging flexible action -- the couch turns into bunk beds, the coffee table flips for a bed sized for Chelsea doll (sold separately), the fireplace becomes a home office, the refrigerator turns into an outdoor food stand and the oven houses a barbecue in back. Lights and sounds add even more delightful touches -- the oven lights up and the timer ticks, the stovetop sizzles with the frying pan and whistles with the tea kettle and the toilet makes a flushing sound. Young decorators will have so much fun moving accessories around the house as they explore their personal style and tell all kinds of stories, from daytime to nighttime, indoor to outdoor, Barbie home alone or with a house full of friends and family (dolls sold separately). Pool parties, friend sleepovers, sister bonding, backyard BBQs, birthday, holidays and every day -- there are endless stories to tell and limitless ways to explore living in the Barbie Dreamhouse because with Barbie, anything is possible.

Each piece is numbered and color-coded to make identifying them easy. These components combine to create working circuit boards just like the ones found inside televisions, radios, and other electronic devices.\nSimple, Fun Projects Let Kids Learn While They Play\nWith its easy-to-follow instructions, Snap Circuits gives your child a hands-on education in how electrical circuits run the everyday devices that they're familiar with. They'll also gain valuable lessons in building and in following instructions. The project manuals include large color illustrations and simple directions for each project.\nThe project list includes all of the projects included in the SC-100 set and 204 additional projects, including a photosensitive electronic organ, a lie detector, an AM radio, and a two-finger touch lamp. With these projects, children will experiment with electric switches, integrated circuits, digital circuits, fuses, and the transformation of circuit sounds into other sounds.\nGrow as You Go\nBecause the projects are arranged in order of complexity, kids can build on their skills as they progress through the manual. The lessons start out with a simple electric light and switch project that demonstrates how electricity is turned on and off with a switch.

Our 12-Cup Coffee Maker brews flavorful coffee that meets the Specialty Coffee Association’s (SCA) Golden Cup standard—whether you’re making a full carafe or a single mug. The fully programmable Coffee Maker has a glass water tank and comes with two brew basket sizes, based on your needs: 2-4 cups (small) or 5-12 cups (large). The podless single-serve option utilizes the smaller brew basket so you can brew directly into a mug without the need for a pod. The included drip tray elevates your coffee mug to prevent splashes during brewing. Need to brew a larger batch? The double-wall, vacuum-insulated thermal carafe holds up to 12 cups (60 ounces) and keeps your coffee hot for lasting enjoyment. With the carafe’s brew-through, pour-through lid, you don’t have to fuss with turning or opening the carafe lid before pouring. The detachable mixing tube pushes coffee as it brews, to ensure the last cup is as delicious as the first. The interactive display screen is easy to use. Simply select the amount you’d like to brew and whether you’d like to brew now or later, then press start. The BetterBrew™ precision technology gets to work, controlling water temperature and brewing time, while the Rainmaker head distributes water evenly over coffee grounds to ignite the bloom cycle for optimum flavor extraction. Our Coffee Maker has a sleek, streamlined stainless steel design that fits under most cabinets and is easy to maintain. The glass water tank can be cleaned by hand and maintained using OXO Brew’s Descaling Solution (sold separately). The carafe and lid are hand wash only. The carafe lid’s mixing tube, removable Rainmaker, drip tray, brew baskets, and coffee scoop are top-rack dishwasher safe.

The Breville Smart Oven began with the simple fact that different foods require different methods of heating: some, like baked goods, need to be cooked evenly; others, like meats, need to be seared on top. Most toaster ovens fail to distribute heat in a consistent way throughout their interiors, let alone change heat distribution to suit the different foods being prepared. This is how the Breville Smart Oven stands apart: whatever the food, it adjusts its heat distribution for perfect results. The Smart Oven is equipped with Element IQ cooking technology, which adjusts the power of the five individual quartz heating elements to cook food more evenly and quickly. This sophisticated heating system distributes heat throughout the oven when and where it is needed, to guarantee more efficient cooking. Nine different menu options allow users to choose the best setting for the food they are cooking. In addition to dynamically distributing heat to different areas, the Smart Oven can adjust the wattage of its heating elements for even more cooking flexibility. Most ovens have elements with fixed wattage that can only switch between ON and OFF, but Element IQ functions much like a dimmer on a light switch, increasing or decreasing element power with a simple turn of the knob. For example, broiling requires high heat from above in order to melt and brown, so the Smart Oven activates 1500W of high heat from the top elements of the oven. On the other hand, toast needs to be cooked evenly on both sides without drying out the inside, so the Smart Oven uses high radiated heat from above and below (1800W distributed between four elements) to crisp the outside quickly. Baking utilizes another feature of the Smart Oven that contributes to even heating: convection heating. Convection cooking uses a fan to circulate hot air so all sides of the food cook at the same rate. This is particularly important for baked goods, such as cookies and cakes, which need to be cooked evenly all the way through. Each of these nine functions is preset with recommended settings, taking the guesswork out of cooking. However, each can be customized according to recipe, volume of food, or personal taste. Customized settings will remain in the memory of the oven until changed or until the oven is unplugged from the wall outlet, streamlining your cooking process. The Smart Oven is carefully constructed from the most durable materials. It is attractively housed in Reinforced stainless steel, a striking addition to any kitchen. The elements themselves are composed of quartz, rather than the metal elements found in other toaster ovens. Quartz responds more quickly to heat change, which results in more even heating throughout the oven. The roomy interior is coated with a non-stick material that can safely withstand high temperatures, making cleanup easier. A crumb/drip tray that is accessible from the front of the oven (rather than the back, like many other toaster ovens) also makes it easier to clean between cooking sessions. In addition, the oven includes a patented magnetic auto-eject rack: small magnets embedded on the sides of the oven door pull the wire rack halfway from the oven when the door is opened, making food easier to remove and preventing burns. At 18.5 x16.25 x11.25 inches, the Breville Smart Oven is not too small but not too large. It is larger than most toaster ovens, with space to comfortably fit six slices of toast, a 13-inch pizza, or a whole Chicken. However, as a countertop convection oven, it is more space-efficient than a conventional wall oven. A smaller oven means less time to heat up and less time to cook, perfect for preparing a meal in a hurry (or for cooks who like to create in the heat of the moment). This also translates into a cooler kitchen (particularly convenient in the hot summer months) and less energy consumed.\"\nList Price: $299.95\nCost: $159.99\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Better than that, it offers six different preset heat settings, which allows for steeping tea at just the right temperature depending on the variety. Using the simple one-touch controls on the kettle's handle, select 160 degrees F for delicate teas, 175 degrees F for green tea, 185 degrees F for white tea, 190 degrees F for oolong tea, 200 degrees F for French press coffee, and \"Boil\" for black tea or to make instant cocoa, oatmeal, noodles, and more. Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp Cordless Programmable Kettle The control panel also offers blue LED indicators, a \"start\" button, and a \"keep warm\" button, which will maintain the set temperature for 30 minutes. For added convenience, the kettle's 360-degree swivel base allows for pouring without the hassle of a power cord getting in the way, and its memory function makes it possible to remove the kettle from its base for two minutes without it shutting off or losing its place in the heating process. Other highlights include a stay-cool nonslip handle, an \"open\" button for lifting the lid, a blue backlit water window with measurement marks, a concealed heating element to prevent mineral buildup, a removable/washable scale filter, a dripless pour spout, and boil-dry protection with auto shutoff for safety. A user manual with recipes comes included. The kettle measures approximately 8-1/5 by 9-4/5 by 12 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty. Parts and Benefits.

When returned to the base, it will restart the heating and/or Keep Warm cycles right where they left off. Keep Warm Mode Keep Warm is the kettle’s default function that automatically maintains selected temperature for 30 minutes. If you have selected the Boil preset, your unit will hold a temperature just below boiling during the Keep Warm cycle. To bring water back to a rolling boil, press the Start button twice. Keep Warm can be turned off by pressing the Keep Warm button at any time before or during the heating cycle. ; Boil-Dry Protection Your kettle is equipped with boil-dry protection. If it starts heating without enough water in the unit, the heater will automatically shut off to avoid damaging the heating element. The lights will flash and the unit will beep to alert you. Once the kettle has cooled down, lift it off the base, then replace it to reset and restart the heating cycle. The quickest way to cool down the heater is to fill the kettle with cold water; however, you can also wait for it to cool down by itself. ; Sleep Mode If the unit is not in use for 5 minutes, it will revert to sleep mode. The heater and all lights will be off, but your last selections will remain in the unit’s memory. To turn the kettle back on, simply press any button, or lift it up and then return it to the base.\"\nList Price: $99.95\nCost: $51.04\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Its versatile design allows you to plug it into any standard outlet and rotate the trap as needed. The trap is the ideal choice for homes with children and pets. The Safer Home Indoor Plug-in Fly Trap generates UV LED light which naturally draws in a wide variety of flying insects. Once insects are drawn in by the light, they get stuck fast to the StickyTech Glue Cards, where they are securely held until the time of disposal. Trapped insects are hidden on the back of the StickyTech Glue Card, so you and your guests never have to see them. Each trap provides up to 400 square feet of coverage so even large rooms are protected. The Safer Home Indoor Plug-in Fly Trap was designed with ease of use in mind. Simply peel the backing off the StickyTech glue card and insert it into the trap. Plug the trap into a standard outlet near common insect hotspots, including near houseplants, exterior doors, pet areas, in kitchens, bedrooms, and other areas of your home. Allow the trap to run continuously for 24/7 protection. The trap is also reusable.

There are three versions which serve the same function. The Y-anchor stake is specifically for 1/4-inch tubing and is ideal for positioning dripper/emitters. The C-anchor stake is a purpose-built plastic anchor stake that has a loop which secures both 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch tubing with barbs on the stake itself that anchor it firmly in the soil. The loop anchor stakes/staples come in 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch versions and are very similar to traditional landscape fabric stakes. They work best for firmer soils which provide some grip on the wire. While the C-anchor stake provides a more secure hold in a wider variety of soils, the wire loop anchor stakes provide the dual benefit of holding drip tubing and landscape fabric in place. Each of the anchor stakes is reusable and provides years of reliable service. Drip tubing straps (sold separately) are an excellent way to anchor 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch tubing to walls, railings, and other surfaces.\"\nList Price: $8.45\nCost: $1.97\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

What about the size and weight?\nA:550 Watt per panel. The dimension of one panel is 89.7 x 44.6 x 1.4 inches, and the weight is 62.8 lbs.\n2.Q:How many kWh a day does this solar panel produce?\nA:If your solar panels are exposed to 5 hours of direct sunlight per day, it can provide an average of 2200-2750 Watt-hours (2.2 kWh - 2.75 kWh) of electricity (depending on sun availability).\n3.Q:Why choose this high-powered 550 Watt module rather than 5-6 100 Watt solar panels?\nA:High-powered solar panels are primarily used for utility-scale systems, solar power plants, solar farms, residential and commercial applications. Compared with 100 Watt solar panels, these high-powered 550 Watt modules provide maximum power generation for your limited roof space. They also allow the use of fewer mounting systems, including wiring cables, screws, or mounting brackets.\n4.Q:Can these panels be used on a grid-tied system?\nA:Sure, they can. These high-powered 550 Watt solar panels work with on-grid, off-grid, and hybrid systems. But please note that when using them on on-grid and hybrid systems, we recommend that you contact a licensed solar installer familiar with on-grid/hybrid setups.On-Grid solar system means solar power equipment (array or solar panel) is connected to the utility grid.Off-Grid solar system refers to a system that is not connected to the grid.An Off-Grid system is not affected by grid blackouts. A Hybrid system is when your solar panels remain connected to the grid's power lines and have a backup battery system to store excess power.\n5.Q:How should I connect solar panels to my electrical circuit (series vs parallel)?\nA:Solar panels can be connected in series or in parallel to meet your electrical circuit size and power needs.Connecting solar panels in series, the operating voltage output will add up while the current output will remain the same as a single solar panel.When connecting solar panels in parallel, the operating current output will add up while the voltage output will remain the same as a single solar panel.To meet your power system's optimum power output and system rating, you can use parallel and series connections. Please note that we recommend connecting the solar panels with the same open circuit voltage.\n6.Q:Do these panels have pre-drilled holes on the back?\nA:Yes, they have. The pre-drilled holes help you to install the solar panel quickly and securely.\n7.Q:Can this solar panel be adapted to a 12V Marine Battery or 48V Lithium Battery?\nA:Yes, it can. The optimum operating voltage of this 550W solar panel is 41.97V. So it's suitable to use for charging your 12V Marine Battery and 48V Lithium Battery (by connecting at least two solar panels in series). Please note that you need to connect the solar panel(s) to a Charge Controller supporting a 12V or 48V system.\"\nList Price: $2626.85\nCost: $1935.37\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.

Unlike traditional toilet paper that can often be rough and ineffective, the WASHLET quickly provides comfortable warm water cleansing at the touch of a button. A once mundane trip to the bathroom can become a spa-like experience with the addition of a WASHLET. The TOTO WASHLET K300 features instantaneous water heating with five spray settings for front and rear washing, including an optional oscillating or pulsating stream. Equipped with a comfortable heated seat, warm air dryer, and a deodorizer to neutralize odors and enhance your overall experience. The illuminated remote control can be handheld or mounted to the wall for convenient use. The K300 prevents toilet bowl waste buildup by using TOTO's advanced PREMIST technology that sprays the bowl before every use to keep it clean. The new K300 model utilizes TOTO's EWATER+ system when the wand self-cleans. EWATER+ uses electrolyzed water generated by a technologically advanced process, transforming the water into a safe and powerful compound. This cleaning technology helps to keep create peace of mind by cleaning the inside and outside of the wand before and after every use. The WASHLET reduces the need for toilet paper, thus conserving trees and water used to manufacture each roll. As we get older, reduced mobility, medical conditions, and debilitating illnesses can make it increasingly hard to clean ourselves after using the toilet.

The digital display shows if gas is present indicates CO levels in parts per million, allowing you to see if, how, and when levels change.\nAdvanced Technology in an Easy-to-Install, Plug-In Design\nDesigned for home use, the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is a UL-listed, A/C-powered, plug-in alarm that utilizes sophisticated electronic components and sensor technology to protect you and your family from the dangers of CO, methane, and propane exposure. It plugs directly into a standard A/C outlet and includes a 9-volt battery backup that provides continuous monitoring--even during power outages.\nThe Dangers of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Propane Exposure\nThe leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, carbon monoxide (CO) is often referred to as the silent killer because it's odorless, tasteless, and invisible. Carbon monoxide poisoning can come about via a number of sources, including everyday items and appliances in your home or office. And because symptoms of CO poisoning mimic the flu or other common illnesses it can often go undiagnosed.\nLikewise, methane and propane gases are commonly used in homes for cooking, heating, and water heating. Although it happens rarely, gas leaks can sometimes occur inside the home, increasing the risk of fire or explosion.\nAudible Alarm Pattern Alerts you to Elevated CO and Gas Levels\nWhen placed on every level of your home, alarms like the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk can help protect everyone in the house by giving you an unmistakable signal when gas levels have reached an unhealthy point. If unhealthy levels of CO are detected, the alarm will emit four quick audible beeps every five seconds until either levels decrease or the reset button is pressed. If methane gas or propane gas is detected, the alarm will emit beeps every other second with \"GAS\" shown in the display.\nEasy-to-Read Digital Display Shows CO Levels\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is preferred among traditional CO and explosive gas alarms because of its digital display. This display clearly shows levels of CO that the unit has detected and stored-- from 30 to 999 ppm--and it updates every 15 seconds to indicate any abrupt changes or alarming trends. The display also shows the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged. The continuous display also shows if gas is present.\nLED Shows Sensor Status\nWith the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk, you never have to wonder if the sensor is functioning properly. A blinking dot in the lower right-hand corner of the display denotes normal operation, so you can trust that it's working. In addition, you can test alarm function by pressing the test/reset button at any time to verify that the horn and electric circuitry are operating properly.\nConvenient Mounting Options\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a low-profile design that makes it suitable for any room in your home. The detector can be plugged into any standard A/C outlet; it's plug can be snapped into the back of the unit and can be rotated so the alarm remains vertical, independent of whether the electrical socket is mounted vertically or horizontally. In addition, the alarm comes with a 6-foot extension cord, so the unit can be plugged into the wall outlet and then placed on a table or shelf. For the most thorough protection, place an alarm on every level of your home.\nThe UL-listed Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a seven-year life and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.\nAbout Kidde: A UTC Fire and Security Brand\nRenowned for global leadership in fire detection and suppression, Kidde provides solutions ranging from portable fire extinguishers to advanced industrial controls such as flame detection and explosion suppression systems.

Designed by plumbing and tech industry professionals, Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff is installed on the main water supply line of the home. Through the Moen Smart Water App you can see live water use, including water flow rates, pressure and even temperature. If the Smart Water Shutoff detects an issue (e.g. high pressure, freezing water, or a small leak) it will alert you through the App, or other preferred notification methods, so you can assess the issue before it causes costly damage. If there is a catastrophic failure, like a burst pipe or someone leaves the water running, you will be alerted in the App allowing you to shut the water off remotely—no matter where you are. If you fail to respond to the alert or are on vacation, the device can be set to automatically shut off water to help limit damage and loss.\"\nList Price: $687.99\nCost: $346.46\n\nNow, I play the role of buyer and you play the role of seller.
