For those searching for telescopes for astronomy beginners that are infused with the latest computer technology, Celestron‚Äôs NexStar 8SE Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescope fits the bill perfectly. The NexStar 8SE Computerized Telescope features Celestron‚Äôs iconic ‚Äúorange tube‚Äù design and updated technology with the latest features for amazing stargazing for beginners and experienced observers. Celestron‚Äôs signature telescope combines advanced features and excellent optics in one easy-to-use system, the NexStar 8SE. It‚Äôs the perfect choice for your first serious telescope, offering striking views at an economical price.\n\nThe eight-inch primary mirror in this computerized telescope packs enough light-gathering ability to observe the best that our Solar System has to offer, from Saturn‚Äôs rings to the cloud bands on Jupiter and geographic features on the surface of the Moon. When it comes to deep sky objects, take your 8SE to a dark-sky site and you‚Äôll see hundreds of pinpoint stars in the Hercules Globular Cluster, the spiral arms of the Whirlpool Galaxy, and more. Featuring a database of more than 40,000 celestial objects, the 8SE‚Äôs GoTo mount automatically locates and tracks objects for you. You can also take a Sky Tour and let your telescope show you the best objects currently visible. The single fork arm design and sturdy steel tripod all assemble and break down from separate components for easy transportation. SkyAlign technology gets your telescope aligned and ready to observe in minutes. Even if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the night sky, you can easily align your telescope on any 3 bright objects.\n\nThe NexStar 8SE is a telescope that will grow with you as you advance in the hobby of astronomy. It‚Äôs compatible with all the high-tech accessories advanced users love. Provide GPS coordinates to your telescope with SkySync, or add automatic alignment functionality with StarSense AutoAlign.\n\nBuy with confidence from the world‚Äôs #1 telescope brand, based in California since 1960. You‚Äôll also receive a two-year warranty and unlimited access to technical support from our team of US-based experts.\nAmazon.com\nAmazon.com Review Celestron's Nexstar 8 SE telescope combines excellent optics and computerized \"GoTo\" tracking in a package that's light, portable and affordable. The legendary performance of Celestron's orange tube C8 telescope has been updated with high performance Starbright XLT coatings, and the single arm Nexstar mount now includes Celestron's easy to use \"SkyAlign\" technology.\nThe Nexstar 8 SE upholds Celestron's reputation for quality optics. When I use an 11mm Plossl eyepiece (almost 200x magnification) for example, I can easily see the Cassini Division in Saturn's rings. When I look at Jupiter, the pale orange color of Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot is visible, and I've even been able to identify the polar caps and spot dust storms on the planet Mars. A 20mm Plossl eyepiece (about 100x magnification) is a good choice for viewing galaxies and star clusters. When I look at globular cluster M13 in the constellation Hercules the high contrast XLT optics show me a glowing snowflake made of hundreds of tiny pin-point stars! And a low power 32mm Plossl eyepiece is a good choice for views of larger deep space highlights like the Andromeda Galaxy and the Orion Nebula.\nCelestron's patented \"SkyAlign\" system makes the Nexstar 8 SE very easy to use. I just pick the nearest town from the built-in list, enter the date and time, and point the telescope at three bright stars. I don't need a star chart because \"SkyAlign\" identifies the stars for me. When I just want a quick look at the moon or a planet, I like to use the \"Solar System Align\" option. After entering the date and time, I just point the telescope at the moon and press the \"Align\" key. That's all it takes, the computer takes over and the telescope begins tracking quietly and accurately. At star parties I often have my Nexstar up and running while older computerized telescopes are still waiting for their alignment stars to appear in the twilight.\nThe Nexstar 8 SE comes with a simple red-dot finder scope and a basic 25mm eyepiece. You'll want to add a few good eyepieces to take full advantage of the Nexstar 8 SE's excellent optics. At the very least get Celestron's bargain priced Accessory Kit which includes high and low power plossl eyepieces, or treat yourself to some top rated Tele Vue eyepieces. At twenty-four pounds total weight, the Nexstar 8 SE is unusually light and portable for an eight-inch telescope. The drawback of course is that some people will find it too light. Like other Schmidt Cassegrain (SCT) telescopes there are plenty of optional accessories to upgrade this telescope with, such as heavy duty tripods and an optical finder scope. If you want to try astro-photography, however, check out Celestron's CPC 800 Telescope which features a heavy duty mount and tripod and an 8x50 optical finder scope right out of the box. --Jeff Phillips\nPros:\nExcellent optics\nEasy computerized GoTo tracking\nLight, portable and affordable\nCons:\nPlastic accessories\nShort battery life\nToo light for astro-photography\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\"\nList Price: $1599.0\n\nShopping List\ncodename: electronics_227\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $1279.2\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

This majestic Downswept Douglas Fir tree is 7.5 feet tall and 59 inches in diameter at the bottom, giving the tree a wide profile. Friends and family alike will marvel at how the tree closely mimics those outside. Molded from real tree branches for an authentic living tree appearance, this tree features our trademarked ‚ÄòFeel Real‚Äô technology. Hundreds of crush-resistant polyethylene tips form full bodied branches, creating a tree with remarkable realism. The tree is designed with a hinged branch system that allows the branches to swing down for a quick and simple set-up and fold back in for easy storage. Set aside 45-60 minutes after assembly to properly shape the tree by peeling back the branches and pulling the tips apart to give the branches a more full-bodied look. Once the tree is fluffed to your liking, weave your desired lights through the branches starting from the top and moving down towards the bottom. Before dressing the tree in twinkling lights and glistening ornaments, consider placing it in a living room or dining area where it can be viewed from multiple angles and does not block any entryways. Constructed with sturdy, high quality materials and hypo-allergenic, fire-resistant needles, this tree is built to bring holiday cheer for years to come.

Many of these films are debuting for the first time on Blu-ray. Get ready for some exciting thrills and chills as heroes meet villains in a duel to the death! The Assassin In the same year that director/writer Chang Cheh and star Jimmy Wang Yu revolutionized Hong Kong kung fu cinema with One-Armed Swordsman, they also collaborated on this epic of the Six Kingdoms era. Here, Yu is a two-armed swordsman who is also a Wei Empire patriot. Inside the Han Empire, Han Kuei, who comes from the royal family, assumes full power and wants to eliminate loyal officer Yen Sui. Later, our main character is betrayed by a jealous rival and becomes a village butcher. But when he meets Yen Sui, he is sent back on the road of vengeance. Chiao Chiao, the lovely and talented costar of One-Armed Swordsman, here plays Hsia, the love of the hero's life and the strong woman who survives to protect their child. The Thundering Sword Superstar swordswoman Cheng Pei-pei, (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), stars as the daughter of the Poison Master in a Romeo and Juliet-style martial arts adventure concerning a search for the magical \"Heaven and Earth\" weapon in The Thundering Sword. The Golden Swallow The indomitable martial arts team of director Chang Cheh and stunt choreographer Liu Chia-liang continues the compelling saga of The Golden Swallow from King Hu's Come Drink with Me in this sequel of heartbreaking romance, intrigue and stunning action. The Jade Raksha Thanks in great part to Cheng Pei-pei, women in martial arts movies played a more central role in the plots and the swordswomen of the genre became some of the most charismatic figures in Hong Kong cinema. In The Jade Raksha, Cheng Pei-pei becomes a human combine harvester as she hacks and whacks a path through life, avenging the death of her family under the moniker \"The Jade Raksha.\" The Bells of Death The Bells of Death is a whirlwind story about a man embarking on a life-long journey to master the sword, then find and eliminate the three men who killed his family and abducted his sister. The Sword of Swords Jimmy Wang Yu had just exploded into superstardom as One-Armed Swordsman when he teamed with respected writer/director Cheng Kang for this tale of master martial artists vying for the title blad‚Äîa \"weapon of exceptional brilliance.\" And with legendary martial arts choreographers Lau Kar-leung and Tang Chia directing the action, the result is a superb, flat-out adventure of intrigue, deception, and an abduction, delivering one battle after another until it culminates in an amazing all-out slaughter. Killer Dart Rampaging bandits are pillaging peaceful Chinese villages until the grieving dart master Liu Wen Lung sets out with his student, son, and servant to avenge his murdered wife and set things right. Renowned director Ho Meng-Hua‚Äîsoon to be internationally famous for The Flying Guillotine‚Äîmasterfully balances action with intrigue and romance, as the path of righteousness is littered with lies‚Ä¶and corpses. The Invincible Fist The Invincible Fist is one of the few films where the godfather of the kung fu film Chang Cheh headlined Lo Lieh as the leading hero three years before Lo would become the Shaw Brothers' first international star in King Boxer (aka Five Fingers of Death). Here he plays a dedicated chief constable for Tsang Chou village who falls in love with the blind daughter of a bandit who is wreaking havoc. Joining him in all the action and emotion are award-winning actor Ku Feng and future superstar David Chiang. Dragon Swamp Cheng Pei-pei, the screen's greatest swordswoman, teams with Lo Lieh for this amazing, fast-paced adventure of the \"Martial Arts World\"‚Äîwhere everyone is killing to gain the famous \"Jade Dragon Sword.\" Fascinating characters, like the Roaming Knight and the Master of Dragon Swamp, clash in this family feud, which takes place over twenty years. In addition to the spectacular fights, this special production holds an emotional wallop for the finale. The Flying Dagger Godfather of the kung fu film, director Chang Cheh is famous for introducing the revolutionary concept of \"yanggang\" (macho) martial arts movies. Until then, female stars (often in male swordsman roles) ruled the screens. This collaboration between him and swordswoman supreme Cheng Pei-pei is exceptional indeed. Cheng could hold her own with any man, freeing Chang to create the best of all possible martial arts worlds. The Golden Sword Lo Wei remains internationally famous for directing Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan's first major movies. Cheng Pei-pei is now internationally famous for her superlative villainous role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But both were superstars in Hong Kong for decades prior, so any teaming of the superlative \"swordswoman supreme\" and the vaunted director/writer/actor is cause for celebration. Kao Yuen joins them as a noble swordsman, and award-winning actor Ku Feng stars as the Frontier Terror in the evocative and effective \"Martial Arts World\" adventure.\n\nBonus Content:\nDisc 1 - The Assassin (1967):\nAudio Commentary by David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 2 - The Thundering Sword:\nFrom a Western Perspective: An Interview About the Transnational Appeal of The Shaw Brothers with Academic Leon Hunt, Author of \"Kung Fu Cult Masters: From Bruce Lee To Crouching Tiger\"\nInterview with Author and Critic Kim Newman About The Western \"Breakthrough\" Films of Sir Run Run Shaw, Which Took the Producer From East To West\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 3 - The Golden Swallow:\nAudio Commentary by Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nInterview with Actress Cheng Pei-Pei by Fr√©d√©ric Ambroisine\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 4 - The Jade Raksha:\nSlicing at the Stars: An Interview with Critic and Hong Kong Film Expert Tony Rayns, About The Emergence, Key Players, and Success of The Shaw Brothers Wuxia Film\nA Very Vocal Violence: Hong Kong Based Dubber Peter Boczar Reflects on His Time Behind the Microphone for a Number Of Martial Arts Masterpieces.\nDisc 5 - The Bells of Death:\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 6 - The Sword of Swords:\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 7 - Killer Darts:\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, veteran Hong Kong film critic at easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 8 - The Invincible Fist:\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, veteran Hong Kong film critic at easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 9 - Dragon Swamp:\nAudio Commentary with Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 10 - The Flying Dagger:\nAudio Commentary with Frank Djeng of the New York Asian Film Festival\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 11 - The Golden Sword:\nAudio Commentary with Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nCelestial Trailer\n]]>\"\nList Price: $169.98\n\nShopping List\ncodename: movies-tv_16\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $135.984\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Many of these films are debuting for the first time on Blu-ray. Get ready for some exciting thrills and chills as heroes meet villains in a duel to the death! Lady of Steel: Cheng Pei-pei was Hong Kong's first and most celebrated queen of kung fu because her performances set all the standards for future female martial arts stars like Michelle Yeoh. Lady Of Steel is a high-plains-drifter adventure where Cheng Pei-pei plays a swordswoman on a mission: to find the bandits that killed her parents and save the country from foreign invaders. Brothers Five: Years before he was to become famous for directing Bruce Lee in Fist of Fury and Jackie Chan in New Fist of Fury, Lo Wei teamed with superstar swordswoman Cheng Pei-pei (Come Drink with Me) for this action thriller of brotherly love‚Ä¶and death. She stars as Yen Lai, the one woman who can reunite the Kao brothers to rid the Teng Lung Manor of killers‚Äîas well as take revenge for their father's murder. The Crimson Charm: Huang Feng both writes and directs this \"Martial Arts World\" thriller of a noble swordsman and a one-armed swordswoman up against the vicious Crimson Charm gang of thieves and cutthroats. The lovely and lethal Ivy Ling Po teams with the amazing Chang I for a classic tale of good versus evil in which the best man‚Äîand one-armed woman‚Äîwins. The Shadow Whip: This top-ten box office hit reunites the star duo from Come Drink with Me in another classic action adventure. Cheng Pei-pei (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) radiates her trademark charm while wielding the deadly title weapon, which is implicated in multiple murders and a major heist. Whether single-handedly fighting sixteen bandits or avenging her father's brutal death, she demonstrates why she was Hong Kong's number one swordswoman‚Äîand no slouch with the whip either! The Delightful Forest Co-directed by Chang Cheh and Pao Hsueh-li, and written by Ni Kuang, Chang Cheh and Chin Shu-Mei, The Delightful Forest revolves around the legendary hero Wu Sung (Ti Lung), who was sent to the prison in the Meng province after murdering his sister-in-law and a local ruffian. There he was acquainted with the prison officer \"Golden Eye\" Shih En (Tien Ching), who saved Wu from the baton punishment required for new prisoners. Wu found out that Shih's restaurant, \"Delightful Forest,\" was taken by the local thug \"Door God\" Chiang Chung (Chu Mu). The Devil's Mirror: This is Sun Chung's very first film for the Shaw Brothers, making it especially interesting and important. He hit the ground running with this action-filled tale of a \"Devil Girl\" who is setting one clan against another to get her hands on two amazing mirrors with supernatural powers. Only a noble swordsman (played by Lau Dan) and beautiful swordswoman (played by The Thundering Sword star Shu Pei-pei) can stop her. Man of Iron: Chen Kuan-tai exuded incredible power on screen, which his directors used to great advantage in this fight-filled follow-up to the smash hit The Boxer from Shantung. The only thing Chou Lien Huan does wrong is win some money gambling with a Shanghai gang leader's playboy son‚Ä¶but that's enough for the father and child to want obsessive revenge. It all culminates in an incredible climatic fight, choreographed by the legendary Lau Kar-leung and Chan Chuen, co-star of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury. The Water Margin: The Chang Cheh-directed The Water Margin is the martial arts epic of epics‚Ä¶of epics. Based on the true legend of how 108 rebel heroes living in the mountains were able to repeatedly defeat invading Sung armies, the film starred just about anyone who was a name at Shaw Brothers at the time, like David Chiang, Chen Kuan-tai and Ti Lung. The primitive battles ultimately end in sharp, visually effective images of death and defeat. This is a must-see for any movie fan. The Bride from Hell: Never marry a possessed woman‚Ä¶especially one possessed by the spirit of a girl murdered by the uncle of the groom! That is the moral of this fascinating production, released a full two years before the international success of The Exorcist. Justice must be done and an exorcism, Hong Kong-style, must be performed before anyone can rest in peace. Talented Margaret Hsing Hui makes a fetching spirit in this mystery thriller that also incorporates a laugh or two amidst the chills. Heroes Two: Of the dozens of great martial arts movies made by this prolific and respected director, this tale of legendary Shaolin avengers Fang Shih-yu and Hung Hsi-kuan is often considered one of his best. His collaboration with equally renowned kung fu choreographer Lar Kar-leung was apparent in all the performances, but especially with that of charismatic, capable, then 19-year-old Alexander Fu Sheng. This powerful production is a true landmark in kung fu film history. The Flying Guillotine: Director Ho Meng-hua attained cult status among Western kung fu film fans with The Flying Guillotine. One of the Shaw Brothers' biggest martial arts stars, Chen Kuan-tai, plays the leader of a group of killers, commissioned by the Ching Emperor to use a deadly, beheading weapon to assassinate dissidents. Although based on a true story, the film's weapon was a complete fabrication because in real life, no one ever survived to tell what the actual weapon really looked like. The Dragon Missle: The many fans of the internationally popular Flying Guillotine films and international star Lo Lieh (King Boxer) will love this movie, featuring some of the most exciting martial arts machinery ever conceived. Everybody's fighting for a special elixir and the title tool‚Äîan ultra‚Äîcool flying boomerang with blades. There are double crosses and ambushes galore before the culminating clash of sizzling steel that must be seen to be believed.\n\nBonus Content:\nDisc 1 - Lady of Steel:\nAudio Commentary by Cult Film Critic Ian Jane\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 2 - Brothers Five:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nAudio Commentary by Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 3 - The Crimson Charm:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 4 - The Shadow Whip:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 5 - Delightful Forest:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary with Cult Film Critic Ian Jane\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 6 - The Devil's Mirror:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 7 - Man of Iron:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKicks\nAudio Commentary with Chris Poggiali, Co-Author of This Fists Break Bricks and Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAn Iron Will‚ÄîMeredith Lewis, Author of Ask for the Moon: Innovation at Shaw Brothers Studios, A 77-Minute Documentary on The Genesis, Rise, Peak and Fall of the Shaw Brothers Movie Empire\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nGerman Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 8 - The Water Margin:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema blog)\nThe Master: Chang Cheh\nElegant Trails: Ti Lung\nElegant Trails: David Chiang\nExtended Love Scene\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nTV S pot for the U.S. release Seven Blows of the Dragon\nDisc 9 - The Bride from Hell:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKicks\nA More Traditional Terror: Hong Kong Film Historian Tony Rayns Talks Shaw Brothers Horror Films\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 10 - Heroes Two:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary by David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nGerman Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 11 - The Flying Guillotine:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKicks\nAudio Commentary with Chris Poggiali, Co-Author of These Fists Break Bricks and Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nFlying Without Wings: Actor Kai Kang Shares His Memories of Working with the Studio in His First Ever On-Camera Interview\nDubbing Delirium: Joseph Ellison, Dubbing Artist on Flying Guillotine for Its U.S. Release, Reflects on the Early Kung-Fu Film Boom\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 12 - The Dragon Missle:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKic ks\nCutting Comments: Jim Marcovic, Editor of Many Martial Arts Trailers for U.S. Cinemas During The 70s and 80s, Speaks About the Kung Fu Film Boom\nTrailers For Shaw Brothers Classics Volume 1 and the Brave Archer Collection (The Jade Raksha, Little Dragon Maiden, Killer Darts, The Flying Dagger, Dragon Swamp, The Brave Archer and His Mate, The Bells of Death, The Sword of Swords, The Invincible Fist\n]]>\"\nList Price: $187.99\n\nShopping List\ncodename: movies-tv_18\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $150.39200000000002\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Unfortunately, even that begins to look like a futile endeavor after a sandstorm ravages their close-knit community. Meanwhile, a seemingly supernatural mystery begins to unfold when the \"ghost\" that dwells in Murph's room sends her a mysterious set of coordinates - which lead the curious father/daughter duo to a clandestine underground base housing the remnants of NASA. There, renowned physicist Professor Brand (Michael Caine) has been working with a team of astronauts and scientists to find a new planet capable of sustaining human life. Brand quickly persuades Cooper to pilot a mission that will hopefully carry the seeds of human life to a habitable planet in another galaxy.

More than 3 feet tall and 4 feet wide, the Barbie Dreamhouse has so many amazing features -- three stories, eight rooms that include a carport (car not included) and a home office, a working elevator that fits four dolls or a Barbie doll in a wheelchair, a pool that has a slide descending from the story above, five pieces of transforming furniture, lights, sounds and more than 60 additional accessories, including an adorable puppy, that can all be used to decorate, set the scene and play out so many stories. Plug-and-play design helps keep pieces in place as small hands move around (and make clean up easy for adult hands!). Decorations and furniture for indoor and outdoor settings inspire play from all angles, and the transformations provide two-in-one fun while encouraging flexible action -- the couch turns into bunk beds, the coffee table flips for a bed sized for Chelsea doll (sold separately), the fireplace becomes a home office, the refrigerator turns into an outdoor food stand and the oven houses a barbecue in back. Lights and sounds add even more delightful touches -- the oven lights up and the timer ticks, the stovetop sizzles with the frying pan and whistles with the tea kettle and the toilet makes a flushing sound. Young decorators will have so much fun moving accessories around the house as they explore their personal style and tell all kinds of stories, from daytime to nighttime, indoor to outdoor, Barbie home alone or with a house full of friends and family (dolls sold separately). Pool parties, friend sleepovers, sister bonding, backyard BBQs, birthday, holidays and every day -- there are endless stories to tell and limitless ways to explore living in the Barbie Dreamhouse because with Barbie, anything is possible.

This filmed version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a cr√®me de la cr√®me cast, including Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and more. Especially fine is the interplay between Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his schoolmates Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), as well as his protector, the looming Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). The second-half adventure--involving the titular sorcerer's stone--doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel; this is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film. Writer Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus keep the spooks in check, making this a true family film, and with its resourceful hero wide-eyed and ready, one can't wait for Harry's return. Ages 8 and up. --Doug Thomas\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\nFirst sequels are the true test of an enduring movie franchise, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets passes with flying colors. Expanding upon the lavish sets, special effects, and grand adventure of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry involves a darker, more malevolent tale (parents with younger children beware), beginning with the petrified bodies of several Hogwarts students and magical clues leading Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) to a 50-year-old mystery in the monster-laden Chamber of Secrets. House elves, squealing mandrakes, giant spiders, and venomous serpents populate this loyal adaptation (by Sorcerer's Stone director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves), and Kenneth Branagh delightfully tops the supreme supporting cast as the vainglorious charlatan Gilderoy Lockhart (be sure to view past the credits for a visual punchline at Lockhart's expense). At 161 minutes, the film suffers from lack of depth and uneven pacing, and John Williams' score mostly reprises established themes. The young, fast-growing cast offers ample compensation, however, as does the late Richard Harris in his final screen appearance as Professor Albus Dumbledore. Brimming with cleverness, wonderment, and big-budget splendor, Chamber honors the legacy of J.K. Rowling's novels. --Jeff Shannon\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\nSome movie-loving wizards must have cast a magic spell on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, because it's another grand slam for the Harry Potter franchise. Demonstrating remarkable versatility after the arthouse success of Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n, director Alfonso Cuar√≥n proves a perfect choice to guide Harry, Hermione, and Ron into treacherous puberty as the now 13-year-old students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry face a new and daunting challenge: Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison, and for reasons yet unknown (unless, of course, you've read J.K. Rowling's book, considered by many to be the best in the series), he's after Harry in a bid for revenge. This dark and dangerous mystery drives the action while Harry (the fast-growing Daniel Radcliffe) and his third-year Hogwarts classmates discover the flying hippogriff Buckbeak (a marvelous CGI creature), the benevolent but enigmatic Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), horrifying black-robed Dementors, sneaky Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), and the wonderful advantage of having a Time-Turner just when you need one. The familiar Hogwarts staff returns in fine form (including the delightful Michael Gambon, replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson as the goggle-eyed Sybil Trelawney), and even Julie Christie joins this prestigious production for a brief but welcome cameo. Technically dazzling, fast-paced, and chock-full of Rowling's boundless imagination (loyally adapted by ace screenwriter Steve Kloves), The Prisoner of Azkaban is a Potter-movie classic. --Jeff Shannon\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\nThe latest entry in the Harry Potter saga could be retitled Fast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.\nBut don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action in Goblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet. Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the other Potter films, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation. --Ellen A. Kim\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\nAlas! The fifth Harry Potter film has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix begins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of any HP movie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.\nHarry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaper The Daily Prophet to smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.\nThis film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone. As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is a good movie. --Jordan Thompson\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\nThe sixth installment of the Harry Potter series begins right where The Order of the Phoenix left off. The wizarding world is rocked by the news that \"He Who Must Not Be Named\" has truly returned, and the audience finally knows that Harry is \"the Chosen One\"--the only wizard who can defeat Lord Voldemort in the end. Dark forces loom around every corner, and now regularly attempt to penetrate the protected walls of Hogwarts School. This is no longer the fun and fascinating world of magic from the first few books‚Äîit's dark, dangerous, and scary.\nHarry (Daniel Radcliffe) suspects Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) to be a new Death Eater recruit on a special mission for the Dark Lord. In the meantime, Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seems to have finally removed the shroud of secrecy from Harry about the dark path that lies ahead, and instead provides private lessons to get him prepared. It's in these intriguing scenes that the dark past of Tom Riddle (a.k.a. Voldemort) is finally revealed. The actors cast as the different young versions of Riddle (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin and Frank Dillane) do an eerily fantastic job of portraying the villain as a child. While the previous movies' many new characters could be slightly overwhelming, only one new key character is introduced this time: Professor Horace Slughorn (with a spot-on performance by Jim Broadbent). Within his mind he holds a key secret in the battle to defeat the Dark Lord, and Harry is tasked by Dumbledore to uncover a memory about Voldemort's darkest weapon--the Horcrux. Despite the long list of distractions, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) still try to focus on being teenagers, and audiences will enjoy the budding awkward romances. All of the actors have developed nicely, giving their most convincing performances to date.\nMore dramatic and significant things go down in this movie than any of its predecessors, and the stakes are higher than ever. The creators have been tasked with a practically impossible challenge, as fans of the beloved J.K. Rowling book series desperately want the movies to capture the magic of the books as closely as possible. Alas, the point at which one accepts that these two mediums are very different is the point at which one can truly enjoy these brilliant adaptations. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is no exception: it may be the best film yet. For those who have not read the book, nail-biting entertainment is guaranteed. For those who have, the movie does it justice. The key dramatic scenes, including the cave and the shocking twist in the final chapter, are executed very well. It does a perfect job of setting up the two-part grand finale that is to follow. --Jordan Thompson\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I is a brooding, slower-paced film than its predecessors, the result of being just one half of the final story (the last book in the series was split into two movies, released in theaters eight months apart). Because the penultimate film is all buildup before the final showdown between the teen wizard and the evil Voldemort (which does not occur until The Deathly Hallows, Part II), Part I is a road-trip movie, a heist film, a lot of exposition, and more weight on its three young leads, who up until now were sufficiently supported by a revolving door of British Thespis throughout the series. Now that all the action takes place outside Hogwarts--no more Potions classes, Gryffindor scarves, or Quidditch matches--Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Rupert Grint (Ron) shoulder the film almost entirely on their own. After a near-fatal ambush by Voldemort's Death Eaters, the three embark on a quest to find and destroy the remaining five horcruxes (objects that store pieces of Voldemort's soul). Fortunately, as the story gets more grave--and parents should be warned, there are some scenes too frightening or adult for young children--so does the intensity. David Yates, who directed the Harry Potter films Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince, drags the second half a little, but right along with some of the slower moments are some touching surprises (Harry leading Hermione in a dance, the return of Dobby in a totally non-annoying way). Deathly Hallows, Part I will be the most confusing for those not familiar with the Potter lore, particularly in the shorthand way characters and terminology weave in and out. For the rest of us, though, watching these characters over the last decade and saying farewell to a few faces makes it all bittersweet that the end is near (indeed, an early scene in which Hermione casts a spell that makes her Muggle parents forget her existence, in case she doesn't return, is particularly emotional). Despite its challenges, Deathly Hallows, Part I succeeds in what it's most meant to do: whet your appetite for the grand conclusion to the Harry Potter series. --Ellen A. Kim\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II\nThe Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the film all Harry Potter fans have waited 10 years to see, and the good news is that it's worth the hype--visually stunning, action packed, faithful to the book, and mature not just in its themes and emotion but in the acting by its cast, some of whom had spent half their lives making Harry Potter movies. Part 2 cuts right to the chase: Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has stolen the Elder Wand, one of the three objects required to give someone power over death (a.k.a. the Deathly Hallows), with the intent to hunt and kill Harry. Meanwhile, Harry's quest to destroy the rest of the Horcruxes (each containing a bit of Voldemort's soul) leads him first to a thrilling (and hilarious--love that Polyjuice Potion!) trip to Gringotts Bank, then back to Hogwarts, where a spectacular battle pitting the young students and professors (a showcase of the British thesps who have stolen every scene of the series: Maggie Smith's McGonagall, Jim Broadbent's Slughorn, David Thewlis's Lupin) against a dark army of Dementors, ogres, and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter, with far less crazy eyes to make this round). As predicted all throughout the saga, Harry also has his final showdown with Voldemort--neither can live while the other survives--though the physics of that predicament might need a set of crib notes to explain. But while each installment has become progressively grimmer, this finale is the most balanced between light and dark (the dark is quite dark--several familiar characters die, with one significant death particularly grisly); the humor is sprinkled in at the most welcome times, thanks to the deft adaptation by Steve Kloves (who scribed all but one of the films from J.K. Rowling's books) and direction by four-time Potter director David Yates. The climactic kiss between Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), capping off a decade of romantic tension, is perfectly tuned to their idiosyncratic relationship, and Daniel Radcliffe has, over the last decade, certainly proven he was the right kid for the job all along. As Prof. Snape, the most perfect of casting choices in the best-cast franchise of all time, Alan Rickman breaks your heart. Only the epilogue (and the lack of chemistry between Harry and love Ginny Weasley, barely present here) stand a little shaky, but no matter: the most lucrative franchise in movie history to date has just reached its conclusion, and it's done so without losing its soul. --Ellen A.

Better than that, it offers six different preset heat settings, which allows for steeping tea at just the right temperature depending on the variety. Using the simple one-touch controls on the kettle's handle, select 160 degrees F for delicate teas, 175 degrees F for green tea, 185 degrees F for white tea, 190 degrees F for oolong tea, 200 degrees F for French press coffee, and \"Boil\" for black tea or to make instant cocoa, oatmeal, noodles, and more.

For added convenience, the kettle's 360-degree swivel base allows for pouring without the hassle of a power cord getting in the way, and its memory function makes it possible to remove the kettle from its base for two minutes without it shutting off or losing its place in the heating process. Other highlights include a stay-cool nonslip handle, an \"open\" button for lifting the lid, a blue backlit water window with measurement marks, a concealed heating element to prevent mineral buildup, a removable/washable scale filter, a dripless pour spout, and boil-dry protection with auto shutoff for safety.

When returned to the base, it will restart the heating and/or Keep Warm cycles right where they left off. Keep Warm Mode Keep Warm is the kettle‚Äôs default function that automatically maintains selected temperature for 30 minutes.

Keep Warm can be turned off by pressing the Keep Warm button at any time before or during the heating cycle. ; Boil-Dry Protection Your kettle is equipped with boil-dry protection. If it starts heating without enough water in the unit, the heater will automatically shut off to avoid damaging the heating element. The lights will flash and the unit will beep to alert you. Once the kettle has cooled down, lift it off the base, then replace it to reset and restart the heating cycle. The quickest way to cool down the heater is to fill the kettle with cold water; however, you can also wait for it to cool down by itself. ; Sleep Mode If the unit is not in use for 5 minutes, it will revert to sleep mode.

The convenient mobile app allows you to control Landroid from the palm of your hand and suggests an auto schedule to best fit your lawns size and conditions. Landroid mows more frequently than other mowers, its offset razor-like blades cut a little off the top during every mow cycle and mow closer to the perimeter of the lawn. When the battery gets low Landroid knows to head back to its charing base to rest and recharge. Each wheel is driven by an independent brushless motor that gives it more maneuverability and helps it to navigate obstacles and slopes up to 20¬∞. Select from 5 cutting height adjustments from 1.9‚Äù-3.5‚Äù with the turn of a knob. Landroid is also customizable with a full line of accessories to meet the unique needs of your lawn.

Whether you have flies, fruit flies, moths, or gnats, you can count on this trap for effective insect control.

Its versatile design allows you to plug it into any standard outlet and rotate the trap as needed. The trap is the ideal choice for homes with children and pets. The Safer Home Indoor Plug-in Fly Trap generates UV LED light which naturally draws in a wide variety of flying insects. Once insects are drawn in by the light, they get stuck fast to the StickyTech Glue Cards, where they are securely held until the time of disposal. Trapped insects are hidden on the back of the StickyTech Glue Card, so you and your guests never have to see them. Each trap provides up to 400 square feet of coverage so even large rooms are protected. The Safer Home Indoor Plug-in Fly Trap was designed with ease of use in mind. Simply peel the backing off the StickyTech glue card and insert it into the trap. Plug the trap into a standard outlet near common insect hotspots, including near houseplants, exterior doors, pet areas, in kitchens, bedrooms, and other areas of your home. Allow the trap to run continuously for 24/7 protection. The trap is also reusable.

The C-anchor stake is a purpose-built plastic anchor stake that has a loop which secures both 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch tubing with barbs on the stake itself that anchor it firmly in the soil. The loop anchor stakes/staples come in 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch versions and are very similar to traditional landscape fabric stakes. They work best for firmer soils which provide some grip on the wire. While the C-anchor stake provides a more secure hold in a wider variety of soils, the wire loop anchor stakes provide the dual benefit of holding drip tubing and landscape fabric in place. Each of the anchor stakes is reusable and provides years of reliable service.

This layer increases the panel's energy generation by boosting efficiency.\nHalf-Cell architecture improves shade tolerance, ensuring better electrical performance over conventional modules.\nCompared with a standard 5-Busbar design, the 10-Busbar design reduces the impact of microcracks and minimizes the cell gap to ensure performance and increase the module's efficiency.\nHigher Efficiency\n- Renogy's 550W monocrystalline solar panel provides an average of 2200-2750 Watt-hours (Wh) power per day (depending on sun availability).\n- It has passed the strict electroluminescence (EL) test without any microcracks. No hot spots.\nMore Power, Less Space\n- Engineered with industry-leading technologies, this high-powered 550W solar panel provides maximum power generation for your limited roof space.\n- It's an economical long-term investment for utility-scale systems, solar power plants, residential and commercial applications.\nCorrosion-Resistant Aluminum Frame\n- Corrosion-resistant aluminum frame design ensures the solar panel survives in harsh outdoor environments, including the burning sun and heavy rain.\n- Provides an extended period of work time without damage or loss of performance.\nPre-Drilled Holes for Easy Installation\n- Renogy solar panels are equipped with back frame and ground mounting holes, ready for installation.\n- They are easy to mount and secure, ideal for off-grid, on-grid, and hybrid solar systems.\nExtreme Weather Endurance\n- Withstand up to 5400 Pa of heavy snow load and up to 2400 Pa of high wind.\n- Provide excellent durability in a harsh environment.\nExtended Durability\n- IP68 rated waterproof junction box and solar connectors ensure that water and dust will not enter during extended outdoor use.\n- The built-in bypass diodes protect the solar cells from overheating, allowing the solar panel to perform during accidental shading by bypassing the underperforming cells.\n550W Monocrystalline Solar Panel 50in Tilt Mount Brackets 320W Monocrystalline Solar Panel 450W Bifacial Solar Panels 550W Bifacial Solar Panels 800W 12V Monocrystalline Solar Kit\nMaximum Power 550 Watt 50 inch 320 Watt Bifacial 450 Watt Bifacial 550 Watt 800 Watt\nItem Dimensions 89.7 x 44.6 x 1.4 in 50 x 1.97 x 0.98 in 65.6 x 39.4 x 1.4 in 75.2 x44.6 x 1.4 in 91.73 x 47.24 x 1.4 in 41.8 x 20.9 x 11.2 in\nItem Weight 62.8 lbs 7.20 lbs 39.7 lbs 50.9 lbs 67.85 lbs 125.3 lbs\nFAQ\n1.Q:Is each panel 550 Watt or a whole combination? What about the size and weight?\nA:550 Watt per panel. The dimension of one panel is 89.7 x 44.6 x 1.4 inches, and the weight is 62.8 lbs.\n2.Q:How many kWh a day does this solar panel produce?\nA:If your solar panels are exposed to 5 hours of direct sunlight per day, it can provide an average of 2200-2750 Watt-hours (2.2 kWh - 2.75 kWh) of electricity (depending on sun availability).\n3.Q:Why choose this high-powered 550 Watt module rather than 5-6 100 Watt solar panels?\nA:High-powered solar panels are primarily used for utility-scale systems, solar power plants, solar farms, residential and commercial applications. Compared with 100 Watt solar panels, these high-powered 550 Watt modules provide maximum power generation for your limited roof space. They also allow the use of fewer mounting systems, including wiring cables, screws, or mounting brackets.\n4.Q:Can these panels be used on a grid-tied system?\nA:Sure, they can. These high-powered 550 Watt solar panels work with on-grid, off-grid, and hybrid systems. But please note that when using them on on-grid and hybrid systems, we recommend that you contact a licensed solar installer familiar with on-grid/hybrid setups.On-Grid solar system means solar power equipment (array or solar panel) is connected to the utility grid.Off-Grid solar system refers to a system that is not connected to the grid.An Off-Grid system is not affected by grid blackouts. A Hybrid system is when your solar panels remain connected to the grid's power lines and have a backup battery system to store excess power.\n5.Q:How should I connect solar panels to my electrical circuit (series vs parallel)?\nA:Solar panels can be connected in series or in parallel to meet your electrical circuit size and power needs.Connecting solar panels in series, the operating voltage output will add up while the current output will remain the same as a single solar panel.When connecting solar panels in parallel, the operating current output will add up while the voltage output will remain the same as a single solar panel.To meet your power system's optimum power output and system rating, you can use parallel and series connections. Please note that we recommend connecting the solar panels with the same open circuit voltage.\n6.Q:Do these panels have pre-drilled holes on the back?\nA:Yes, they have. The pre-drilled holes help you to install the solar panel quickly and securely.\n7.Q:Can this solar panel be adapted to a 12V Marine Battery or 48V Lithium Battery?\nA:Yes, it can. The optimum operating voltage of this 550W solar panel is 41.97V. So it's suitable to use for charging your 12V Marine Battery and 48V Lithium Battery (by connecting at least two solar panels in series). Please note that you need to connect the solar panel(s) to a Charge Controller supporting a 12V or 48V system.\"\nList Price: $2626.85\n\nShopping List\ncodename: patio-lawn-garden_9\nquantity: 1\nbudget: $2101.48\n\nNow, I play the role of seller and you play the role of buyer.

Correctly tightening fasteners to a vehicle or equipment manufacturer's torque specifications ensures parts are properly secured without being damaged.

To measure torque, set the desired value on the handle scale (foot pounds or Newton meters) and begin tightening the fastener. When the preset torque value is reached, a reliable mechanical operation inside the handle produces a click you can hear and feel, alerting you to stop applying force. Built for consistent performance and years of dependable service, the mechanical design doesn't need batteries, and the allsteel construction has no plastic parts to break or wear out.\nIMPORTANT: This wrench is shipped precalibrated and ready to use.

Setup is easy as the Kidde carbon monoxide alarm plugs into a standard, 120V AC power outlet in your home, while a 9-volt alkaline battery (included) works as a backup in the event of a power failure. When carbon monoxide is detected, the digital display shows the level of carbon monoxide the alarm is sensing and updates every 15 seconds. Peak Level Memory records the last time carbon monoxide was detected or when the unit was tested. The Smart-Hush button silences the unit for approximately 8 minutes, which is helpful when this smoke detector carbon monoxide detector combo sounds from things like routine cooking or shower steam. Extension cord (included) allows for placement on a table or shelf. Install a carbon monoxide smoke detector combo on every level of your home and near bedrooms to help keep your family safe.

The Nighthawk is an easy-to-install unit that provides reliable protection against the dangers of CO and explosive gas. The digital display shows if gas is present indicates CO levels in parts per million, allowing you to see if, how, and when levels change.\nAdvanced Technology in an Easy-to-Install, Plug-In Design\nDesigned for home use, the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is a UL-listed, A/C-powered, plug-in alarm that utilizes sophisticated electronic components and sensor technology to protect you and your family from the dangers of CO, methane, and propane exposure. It plugs directly into a standard A/C outlet and includes a 9-volt battery backup that provides continuous monitoring--even during power outages.\nThe Dangers of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Propane Exposure\nThe leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, carbon monoxide (CO) is often referred to as the silent killer because it's odorless, tasteless, and invisible. Carbon monoxide poisoning can come about via a number of sources, including everyday items and appliances in your home or office. And because symptoms of CO poisoning mimic the flu or other common illnesses it can often go undiagnosed.\nLikewise, methane and propane gases are commonly used in homes for cooking, heating, and water heating. Although it happens rarely, gas leaks can sometimes occur inside the home, increasing the risk of fire or explosion.\nAudible Alarm Pattern Alerts you to Elevated CO and Gas Levels\nWhen placed on every level of your home, alarms like the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk can help protect everyone in the house by giving you an unmistakable signal when gas levels have reached an unhealthy point. If unhealthy levels of CO are detected, the alarm will emit four quick audible beeps every five seconds until either levels decrease or the reset button is pressed. If methane gas or propane gas is detected, the alarm will emit beeps every other second with \"GAS\" shown in the display.\nEasy-to-Read Digital Display Shows CO Levels\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is preferred among traditional CO and explosive gas alarms because of its digital display. This display clearly shows levels of CO that the unit has detected and stored-- from 30 to 999 ppm--and it updates every 15 seconds to indicate any abrupt changes or alarming trends. The display also shows the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged. The continuous display also shows if gas is present.\nLED Shows Sensor Status\nWith the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk, you never have to wonder if the sensor is functioning properly. A blinking dot in the lower right-hand corner of the display denotes normal operation, so you can trust that it's working. In addition, you can test alarm function by pressing the test/reset button at any time to verify that the horn and electric circuitry are operating properly.\nConvenient Mounting Options\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a low-profile design that makes it suitable for any room in your home. The detector can be plugged into any standard A/C outlet; it's plug can be snapped into the back of the unit and can be rotated so the alarm remains vertical, independent of whether the electrical socket is mounted vertically or horizontally. In addition, the alarm comes with a 6-foot extension cord, so the unit can be plugged into the wall outlet and then placed on a table or shelf. For the most thorough protection, place an alarm on every level of your home.\nThe UL-listed Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a seven-year life and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.\nAbout Kidde: A UTC Fire and Security Brand\nRenowned for global leadership in fire detection and suppression, Kidde provides solutions ranging from portable fire extinguishers to advanced industrial controls such as flame detection and explosion suppression systems.
